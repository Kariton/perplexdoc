# Documentation for the Perplex theme

**[Perplex](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex) is a typographic theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).**

It’s online for testing purposes at <https://perplex.desider.at> and <https://bowman2001.github.io/perplexdoc>. The first beta release of the theme is available. The documentation itself still needs some work. I’m gonna finish it in the next few weeks.

The theme is included in this documentation project as a module from <https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex>. You don’t need a Golang environment to build, because there is always a recent copy available in the `_vendor` path.

## Work in progress

- The layout may still contain bugs.

- The documentation covers a lot, but there are still some elements missing.
