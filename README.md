# Documentation and Demo for the Perplex theme

**[Perplex](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex) is a typographic theme for technical publishing with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).**

The theme is included in this documentation project as a module from <https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex>. You donâ€™t need a Golang environment to build because there is always a recent copy available in the `_vendor` path.
