# Documentation for _Perplex_

**_Perplex_ is a typographic theme for [_Hugo_](https://gohugo.io).**

It’s online for testing purposes: <https://perplex.desider.at>

## Work in progress

- There’s no start page. If you want to have a look, begin with the [documentation section](https://perplex.desider.at/doc) 
- The layout still contains bugs
- There is a lot of content, but some later pages are still unfinished.
- The theme is available in the `themes` folder as usual, but hasn’t been released properly yet.
