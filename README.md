# Documentation for **Perplex**

**[Perplex](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex) is a typographic theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).**

It’s online for testing purposes at <https://bowman2001.github.io/perplexdoc> and hasn’t been released yet.

The theme is included in this project as hugo module from <https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex>. You don’t need a Golang environment to build, because there is always a recent copy available in the `_vendor` path.

## Work in progress

- The layout still contains bugs.

- The documentation is there, but some pages are missing, unfinished, or need an update.
