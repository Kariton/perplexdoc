# Documentation for _Perplex_

**[_Perplex_](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex) is a typographic theme for [_Hugo_](https://gohugo.io).**

It’s online for testing purposes at <https://perplex.desider.at> and hasn’t been released properly yet.

The theme is included in this project as a hugo module from <https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex>. But you don’t need _Git_ nor a _Golang environment_ to start with, because there is always a recent copy available in the `_vendor` path.

## Work in progress

- The start page is unfinished. If you want to have a look, you best begin with the [documentation section](https://perplex.desider.at/doc)

- The layout still contains bugs.

- There is a lot of content in the documentation, but some pages are unfinished or need an update.
