Marginal notes allow to add further information in an elegant and unobtrusive way. We can glance over them and stay with the main text or digress shortly, when they pique our curiosity.

The famous mathematician Fermat wrote his last conjecture around 1637 in the marginal column besides an ancient greek proof by Diophantus. The “marvellous proof” Fermat mentioned there has never been uncovered, but his note kept mathematicians busy for over 350 years --- until one of them could actually proof his hypothesis after years of ground-breaking work.

Diophantus’ proof and Fermat’s conjecture:  

> To divide a given square into a sum of two squares.
>
> To divide 16 into a sum of two squares.
>
> Let the first summand be x{^2}, and thus the second 16 -- x{^2}. The latter is to be a square. I form the square of the difference of an arbitrary multiple of x diminished by the root of 16, that is, diminished by 4. I form, for example, the square of 2x -- 4. It is 4x{^2} + 16 -- 16x. I put this expression equal to 16 -- x{^2}. I add to both sides x{^2} + 16x and subtract 16. In this way I obtain 5x{^2} = 16x, hence x = {^16}&frasl;{_5}

> Thus one number is {^256}&frasl;{_25} and the other {^144}&frasl;{_25}. The sum of these numbers is 16 and each summand is a square.

It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second, into two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.
