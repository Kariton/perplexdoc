Some doubts have been raised about the accessibility of fluid typography. But websites with a responsive fluid design can behave especially user-friendly and accessible. This site is an example.

Fluid fonts depend on the view-port width of the browser. When a user changes the zoom-factor of his browser, they are not affected at all. That’s why we need to change their value, when we change the layout responsively. Fluid typography is also not suitable on mobile devices for various reasons.

But a responsive fluid design is beneficial on larger screens---tablet sizes and up. Breakpoints depending on the ‘em’-unit are reacting to the zoom setting as usual and allow to fit fluid text precisely into the current layout. And we can easily stop their growth with a suitable breakpoint.

A responsive fluid layout changes to a larger or smaller version in our favor as soon as a breakpoint is reached. And this is working wether we change our screen width or our zoom setting. And not only the fonts but the size of all elements will change, when they consequently rely on ‘rem’ or ‘em’ units. So we may have to change the zoom setting by a larger step, to make a layout change happen---but that’s all there is to it.  

Just give it a try with {#Ctrl} + {#+} and {#Ctrl} + {#-} or the zoom setting of your desktop browser. You will be surprised how well you can zoom in or out with this layout.
