This chapter briefly recapitulates the syntax for extended Markdown elements and shows their standard layout and alternative options.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

PHP Markdown Extra and GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM) introduced some widely used extensions to the CommonMark syntax. They are enabled by default in Hugo but we can disable them separately.

Hugo offers some additional extensions which are disabled by default and can be enabled separately. See the configuration file [{$markup.yaml}](/doc/appendix/config/markup#8) for this site.
