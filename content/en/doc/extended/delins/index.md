Correction marks highlight changes while working on a draft. Lately, strike-through has also become a hip visual style.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

To visually record important changes in our text, we can expressively cancel a part of the previous version by marking it ~~strike-through~~. The opposite action is to mark a part as ++inserted++ later.
{#layex}

## Syntax

Strike-through is applied by surrounding text with two swung dashes on every side like `~~deletion~~`. There is extra Markdown syntax for an insertion available in Hugo working like `‚Äç++insertion++`. This extra extension needs to be enabled in the markup configuration.

## Layout

See the [second paragraph](#layex).

Consider that these markings tend to look unprofessional on a finalized page if it's not some kind of draft or change log.
