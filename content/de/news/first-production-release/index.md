The theme offers an outstanding typographic layout for Markdown content and many options to fit resources like images into its coherent grid.

The following new features since the last beta release are notable:

- Dark mode (follows OS settings)

- Author pages and linked portraits referring to them

- Fast and efficient full-text search with [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app)

- The layout is rich in detail and the pages are still very fast.
