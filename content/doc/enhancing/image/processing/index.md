The theme relies on the powerful integrated Hugo methods.

Many different-sized versions of every image are generated automatically, so every browser client can load a near-optimal size. We only need to supply an original image that is large enough.

## Resolution

The highest **d**evice **p**ixel **r**atio (DPR) that screens may provide in the future is **5**, and the highest DPR in widespread use today is **3**.

The following table contains the original image width we need to provide for those devices and all image sizes.
**Rule of thumb:** For crisp images on high-density screens, we should provide images with double the size of their layout width.

Because the perceived resolution does grow more logarithmically than linearly, the optimal image size is strongly reduced. The actual delivered DPR is shown in parentheses.

| small (embed default) |      {{% mod-img/width "small" 1 %}}      | {{% mod-img/width "small" 2.1 %}}  |  {{% mod-img/width "small" %}}     |

When we build a project with lots of images — more than a hundred like this project — we have to show a little patience on the first Hugo run. Image processing may take a few minutes. The generated images are cached by Hugo and we only have to wait for the processing of new images in subsequent runs.

When we publish our site with the help of a service provider we need to make sure caching works. (&rightarrow; [Publish](/doc/intro/workflow/publish))

## Format & Quality

All raster images are transformed into source sets with the WEBP format because images are smaller than for all its predecessors like JPEP & PNG. The initial qualitiy is by default 85 and gets gradually reduced for higher resolutions.

## Interpolation

In case we can’t provide a large enough version of an image, Perplex applies an [excellent interpolation filter][filter] to enlarge its size smoothly without visible ringing artifacts. Those interpolated images may look blurry nonetheless, there is no way to get the missing information back. A high resolution of the original is always preferable.
