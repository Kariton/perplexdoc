Perplex has been designed to publish technical content. It provides templates for a documentation with up to three section levels, a blog, longer articles (still unfinished) and single pages.

Perplex works out of the box, no other software than a recent Hugo installation and this theme are required to build a website like this one from your Markdown files and your resources.
