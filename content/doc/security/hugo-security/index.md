Static websites generated by _Hugo_ solely based on _Markdown_ content and internal data parameters are extremely secure. We then have to worry about security only at generation time.

Security becomes a concern when we start to use external resources.

Hugo
: Our SSG can be configured to call external software like _GO_, the node module _PostCSS_ or other external software. By default _Perplex_ is self-reliant.

## Don’t allow raw HTML

It’s possible to allow raw HTML inside of Markdown. The benefit seems obvious: We could use missing HTML elements directly. But there are two good reasons, why _Goldmark_ discards all HTML in _Markdown_ by default:

1. The whole purpose of _Markdown_ is to get rid of coding HTML directly.

2. Markdown is meant to be an easy and _safe_ markup for working on text files.    Malicious code could be hidden in HTML.
