To enable the production of secure websites using a workflow, which is itself as secure as possible is one of the essential features of Hugo.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

The _Hugo project_ has outlined its [security model][hugo] in the documentation.

Hugo allows by default to call a few often used binaries at runtime. When we want to include external content as a module for example, we need to enable the use of _Go_. Like with every other Hugo theme, websites generated with Perplex may include external content, but this project does not.

All the other default binaries are also commented out in the [security configuration][secyaml] for this project, because Perplex templates do not call them.
