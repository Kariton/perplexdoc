A Markdown linter helps to unify the markup style of the content. The following short configuration changes a few rules of Markdownlint.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=true" >}}
{{< readfile file="/content/.markdownlint.yaml" >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

There are also configuration files for Markdownlint in some content folders. They allow to document some variations of Markdown.
