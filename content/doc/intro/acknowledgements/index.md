The idea for the classic typographic layout of _Perplex_ grew over a few years out of many already existing concepts.

Without _Hugo_ and its small but very helpful and reliable community I wouldn’t have come this far in implementing it. Special thanks go to the current and long time project leader [_Bjørn Erik Pedersen_][bep] for his constant improvements of the software and his help; to [_Joe Mooring_][jm] for his detailed and precise suggestions; and of course to [_Steve Francia_][sf] for bringing _Hugo_ to life and let it take its first steps.

I borrowed many ideas from the layout of _Matthew Buttericks_ beautiful online book [_Practical Typography_][pt], which also taught me a lot about typography in general and a few things about special habits of the American-English typography.

Without _Chris Coyiers_ extensive and always up-to-date website [_CSS-Tricks_][cc] I would be technically lost. He and his contributors are keeping track of the constantly evolving CSS capabilities like only a few others.
