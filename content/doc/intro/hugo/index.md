The world’s fastest static site generator is steadily gaining traction. Hugo provides a reliable production environment and allows to build fast and secure websites.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a command line tool for macOS, Windows, Linux and BSD derivatives. Binaries for most operating systems and some containers are usually available within a day or a few after every release.

{{< mnote up=11 >}}
The [Hugo source](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) can be compiled on every machine with a recent [Go environment](https://go.dev).
{{< /mnote >}}

## Getting started

The [Hugo documentation site][hugodoc] addresses developers mostly and offers detailed and extensive information. Only a small part of it is necessary to produce a professional static website using a fully functional theme.

### Install Hugo

Please read the [installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for your operating system on the documentation site. Perplex works with any recent version.

### Use Perplex

When you are just getting acquainted with Hugo and Markdown or when you are curious about the source for this site, you can download this documentation project as an example. It’s available on [_GitHub_]({{< param sourceURL >}}) and ships with all the files for the documentation and a few examples for blog postings and simple pages.

#### The documentation project

The folders for the project site contain only a minimal set of standard Hugo folders.

```sh {.right .lh15 .hide-mobile}
├── assets
├── config
└── content
```

`assets`
: contains site wide resources.

`config`
: contains the configuration files for this project.

`content`
: contains all the Markdown files and page specific resources like images.
{.dl-loose}

The additional `_vendor` folder includes a local copy of the [Perplex theme]({{< param themeURL >}}).

#### Start from scratch

We create an empty new project with a command like

```sh {.left}
hugo new site mysite
```

It creates the directory `mysite` and the full standard folder structure.

```sh {.right .lh15 .up-8}
├── archetypes
├── assets
├── config
├── content
├── layout
├── static
└── themes
```

When we use a Hugo theme, it ships with _archetypes_ and _layout_ templates and the correspondent folders in the project root are only meant for modified templates, which may override the ones from the theme.

The _themes_ folder can hold as many themes as we like and there are three ways to retrieve a public theme from a _Git_ repository provider:

1. Download and unzip its compressed file package in the `themes` folder. This is the fastest way and the best option for a try-out.

2. Clone it with [_Git_](https://git-scm.com/) into the `themes` folder. If you already are using _Git_ for your project, you probably should clone every theme as a submodule. This is also the best workflow to contribute to the development of a Hugo theme.  

3. Import the Perplex repository as a Hugo module. You need to have a recent [Go environment](https://go.dev) – Hugo modules rely on _Go_ modules. The Hugo docs provide a [guide to this powerful feature](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules). Once set up, _Hugo modules_ are the easiest way to update themes or other external components of your Hugo configuration. There is an example for the configuration in the file [`module.yaml`]({{< relref "moduleyaml.md" >}}), because this project imports the theme as a module.

{{< mnote up=20 >}}
**This project** doesn’t need a _Go environment_, because it ships with a local copy of the theme (in the `_vendor` folder). If you want to update the theme separately, you need to install _Go_ and run the command `hugo mod get -u`.
{{< /mnote >}}

When you chose option 1. or 2., you need to tell Hugo to use the theme in the [config file]({{< relref "configyaml.md#8" >}}). With the module you don’t, but the entry doesn’t hurt.

## Run Hugo locally {#server-mode}

While working on a web project, we often like to constantly watch the resulting pages. To render and serve an instant local preview, we can run hugo in _server mode_. A command like the following in the root of the Hugo project starts the server:

```sh
hugo server -D --minify --navigateToChanged
```

{{< mnote up=5 >}}
**Hugo’s server** can also show a private preview on the web under a configured URL. But it's by no means a full-fledged web server.
{{< /mnote >}}

The pages are rendered into the computer memory and the site is served under <http://localhost:1313>.

- The flag `-D` lets Hugo include _drafted_ files. All files created with `hugo new` are usually configured as drafts, using `draft = true` in the front-matter. When a Markdown file is ready for publishing, we need to remove this entry or change it to `draft = false`.

- The flag `--minify` tells Hugo to remove unnecessary whitespace from the resulting code.

- The flag `--navigateToChanged` tells the server to automatically relay the page from the last edited file to the browser.

{{< mnote up=8 >}}
With `hugo help` we get an overview of all possible commands and flags.
{{< /mnote >}}

### Adding the first Content {#first}

To generate new Markdown files inside the `content` folder, we use a command like

```sh {.left}
hugo new blog/my-first-post.md
```

The new file resides in the folder `content/blog/`. It contains a front matter section with reasonable entries or placeholders to start with.

`title` and `date` are mandatory, a `description` is strongly recommended for Perplex as it is for many other themes.

```yaml {class="left" linenos=true }
+++
title = "My First Post"
description = "Description"
date = 2021-10-01T21:22:27+02:00
categories = []
tags = []
draft = true
+++
```

The title has been guessed from the file name and the date from the moment we ran the command.[^1]

The Markdown content begins after the front matter. Hugo will update our site in the browser. If we make a mistake, Hugo will display a descriptive error message on its console and in the browser.

[^1]: The templates for new files reside in the folder `archetypes`.

## Content organization

It may take a little while to get your head around Hugo’s content folder structure. To keep the _general concept_ in mind did help me: Hugo establishes a connection between the input  and the generated website, which is as short as possible. The folder structure determines the generated website structure in a similar way like Markdown formatting determines the layout of our content.

The standard folders in the content directory of a Perplex project are the content root itself `/` and the folders `doc`, `blog` and `article`. The theme provides layout templates for these page types. Hugo applies the matching template automatically to every content file inside these directories and their subdirectories.

The root `/`
: contains top level pages, which should

`doc`
`blog`
`article`

### Single pages {#single}

We already created a new file [`blog/my-first-post.md`]({{< relref "#first" >}}). This is the simplest way to generate a new page.

#### Leaf Bundle

When we include resources like images into a page, we like to [retrieve them]({{< relref "#resources" >}}) easily. When we need some files only on a specific page, we can create a _leaf bundle_ like this:

```sh {.left}
hugo new blog/my-second-post/index.md
```

The file `index.md` is rendered again as a single page, but now we can move page-specific resources in the folder of the _leaf branch_ and access them directly via their filename.

{{< mnote up=14 >}}
**Subdirectories** are possible. We can build only one single page with a leaf bundle, but there is no limit to the folder structure for resources.
{{< /mnote >}}

#### Blog posts

When the number of blog entries rises, we need some structure. This is achieved with _taxonomies_, and Hugo’s defaults are the usual _categories_ and _tags_. We can use them immediately, the front matter already includes the empty parameter keys:

{{< mnote up=14 >}}
**New Taxonomies** may be defined in the configuration. Please read the corresponding [docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies#configure-taxonomies).
{{< /mnote >}}

```yaml {class="col-left" linenos=true linenostart=5 }
categories:
tags:
```

When we add our taxonomies as a comma separated list inside the empty `[]`, Hugo will generate additional list pages for every taxonomy we introduced.

#### Documentation Pages

A larger documentation site needs a clear hierarchy, a sidebar navigation and a search engine (TODO!), to find pages as quickly as possible. And to read the documentation like a book, we need references to the next and the previous pages and also to . All these navigational elements are build from parameters in the front matter. When we create a new documentation page with

```sh {.left}
hugo new doc/demo/my-first-doc-page.md
```

we start with a front matter, that contains a few more entries than a blog post. The first 5 lines, that we already have seen, are left out:

```yaml {linenos=true linenostart=6 class=col-left}
weight = 100
[menu.doc]
  name = "My First Doc Page"
  identifier = 'my-first-doc-page'
  parent = ''
  pre = 'remove'
+++
```

The new parameter _weight_ is of general meaning for the order of all pages, the others are menu entries and are lined up under the `` section and are specifically creating the structure of the doc menu `[menu.doc]`.

`weight`
: lets a page fall deeper in the hierarchy, the higher it gets. Right now our new doc page has an entry at the bottom of the sidebar navigation, take a look.

`name`
: is the title of the menu entry. If the page title is very long, we can provide a short version to avoid a messy menu.

`identifier`
: is an internal name, that lets other pages refer to this one as their `parent`.

`parent`
: If this parameter contains the identifier of another page, the current page is a level beyond its parent in the menu. If there is no parent, the page gets a top level menu entry.

`pre`
: is used very specific by Perplex: It contains the identifier of a _Material Icon_ from _Google_. To change it, please visit their [website](http://fonts.google.com/icons). You can pick any icon there. Select it and copy the identifier from the icon font embedding section (It's usually the icon name written in lower letters and with underscores `_` instead of spaces).
{.dl-loose}

### List pages {#list}

Besides single pages we usually need list pages. They can show an overview of  the content of sections and provide some kind of introduction.

#### Branch Bundle

Because our new page is a demonstration, we like to file it in a special section. We create this demo section as a _branch bundle_ with the following command:

```sh {.left}
hugo new doc/demo/_index.md
```

The small difference between a _leaf bundle_ for a [single page]({{< relref "#single" >}}) and a _branch bundle_ is the leading underscore for the Markdown master file. It's only `index.md` versus `_index.md`. But they have a very different purpose. A folder with a _leaf bundle_ collects material for _one_ page. A _branch bundle_ collects as many pages and may include as many other bundles as we need — there is no technical limit to the depth of folder hierarchy. A branch bundle can act like a chapter, section or subsection.

`_index.md` should contain general content about this section. The page for a _branch bundle_ usually also presents a list of selected content from every page in the branch.

{{< mnote up=11 >}}
**No subdirectories** are accessible to retrieve resources in `_index.md`. All resources specific for the list page generated from `_index.md` at the root of the _branch bundle_ need also to be placed in the branch root. This limitation avoids confusion about the purpose of subfolders.
{{< /mnote >}}

To reflect this relationship in the menu, we need to set `parent = "demo"` in `my-first-doc-page` and Hugo rearranges the page structure and the menu alike.

### Page Bundles {#bundle}

[_Branch bundles_]({{< relref "#branch-bundle" >}}) and [_leaf bundles_]({{< relref "#leaf-bundle" >}}) are both _page bundles_. A _branch bundle_ for a list page may also include page resources.

### Page Resources {#resources}

There are three options to store and retrieve resources (like images) for Hugo:

Page specific
: We can save them in the folder of a page bundle and access them there with the shortest possible path.

Site specific
: We save them most suitably in the `assets` folder and can use them on every page of our project. We may have to create a folder structure in `assets` to organize them.

Remote
: Resources may also be retrieved via URL or API. This powerful but complex feature has been introduced recently. No remote connectors ship with Perplex at the moment.
{.dl-loose}

## Project configuration

All configuration options and their defaults are described in the [docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/). The examples therein are given for a **single configuration file** like {$config.yaml} in your project root directory.

The configuration for this Perplex site is using the alternative option of a **configuration directory** named {$config} with separate files for the sections. For the growing number of options this arrangement is much clearer. The top configuration file is still called {$config.yaml} the other ones are named like the section they contain.

### Please note {.h-info .h-p}

The configuration files for sections don't include the section identifier anymore, because the name of the file _is_ the section identifier. When you adopt a configuration option from the Hugo docs, you may therefore need to remove the section identifier.
