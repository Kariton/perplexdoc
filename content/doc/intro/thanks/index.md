The idea for a layout based on classical typographic principles grew over a few years out of many already existing concepts. I’m sorry, I can’t mention every helpful author I consulted about typography and web layout techniques.

Without _Hugo_ and its small but very reliable and helpful community I wouldn’t have come this far in implementing these ideas. I owe special thanks to the current and long time project leader [_Bjørn Erik Pedersen_][bep] for his constant improvements of the software and his help; to [_Joe Mooring_][jm] for his detailed and precise suggestions; and of course to [_Steve Francia_][sf], the current head of product for the [Go language][go] at _Google_, for bringing _Hugo_ to life.

_Perplex_ is --- as the name says --- designed around [_IBM’s_][ibm] open corporate font family [_Plex_][plex], which I can only use in a somewhat different way than IBM itself, because their fonts are so versatile and thankfully include a classic serif version.

I borrowed many ideas from the layout of _Matthew Buttericks_ beautiful online book [_Practical Typography_][pt], which also taught me a lot about typography in general and some about distinctive American-English features.

Without _Chris Coyiers_ extensive and always up-to-date website [_CSS-Tricks_][cc] I would have been lost technically. He and his contributors have been keeping track of and explained the constantly evolving CSS capabilities like only a few others.
