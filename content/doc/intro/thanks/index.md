The concept for a layout based on classical typographic principles grew over a few years out of many already existing ideas. I can’t even mention every helpful author I read about typography and web layout techniques. Many conceptual parts date back to [Matthew Butterick’s][mb] beautiful online book [_Practical Typography_][pt], which also taught me a lot about typography in general and some about distinctive American-English features.

Perplex is --- as the name says --- designed on top of [IBM’s][ibm] open corporate font family [Plex][plex]. Their fonts are thankfully very versatile and include a nice serif version.

Without [Chris Coyier’s][cc] extensive and always up-to-date website [CSS-Tricks][cc] I would have been lost in the CSS specs. He and all his contributors have been clarifying the constantly evolving capabilities of CSS like only a few others.

**CSS-Tricks** has been acquired by [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) recently. Hopefully, their staff will keep up the good work.

Without Hugo and its small, but very helpful active community I wouldn’t have started and never came so far in implementing these layout ideas. I owe special thanks to [Steve Francia][sf], for bringing Hugo to life and developing its core; to [Joe Mooring][jm] for his detailed and precise suggestions; and of course to the current and long time project leader [Bjørn Erik Pedersen][bep] for his constant improvements of the software and his advise.
