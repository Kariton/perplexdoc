Place your lead paragraph here. If you don't need special styling, remove the attribute `{.p-first}`. The **more**-tag marks this placeholder paragraph as the content summary for this page. Itâ€™s an introduction for your readers and provides information to search engines.

### Page Resources {#resources}

There are three options to store and retrieve resources (like images) for Hugo:

Page specific
: We can save them in the folder of a page bundle and access them there with the shortest possible path.

Site specific
: We save them most suitably in the `assets` folder and can use them on every page of our project. We may have to create a folder structure in `assets` to organize them.

Remote
: Resources may also be retrieved via URL or API. This powerful but complex feature has been introduced recently. No remote connectors ship with Perplex at the moment.
