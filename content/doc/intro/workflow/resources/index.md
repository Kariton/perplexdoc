This theme expects local resources. All additional files like images need to be placed in page bundles. Page resources from parent sections or taxonomies can be conveniently re-used.

## Hugoâ€™s possibilities {#resources}

There are generally three options to store and retrieve resources (like images) for Hugo:

Page specific
: We can save them in the folder of a page bundle and access them with a short relative path. We can register the resources in the front-matter of the corresponding Markdown file and add meta-data.

Site specific
: We can save them in the {$assets} folder and can use them for every page of our project. The [favorite icon]({{< relref "doc/site/favicon" >}}) is a typical case.

Remote
: Resources may also be retrieved via URL or API. This powerful feature has been introduced recently. No remote connectors ship with Perplex at the moment.
