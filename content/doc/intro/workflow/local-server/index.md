While working on our content, we like to examine the result. To generate an immediate local preview, we run Hugo in server mode.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

The following instructions assume, that you have opened a terminal and changed to your project root containing a copy of this documentation project.

## Hugo’s server mode

```sh {.left}
hugo server -D --navigateToChanged 
```

This command in the root of a project starts the [Hugo server][server]. All the HTML pages are rendered into memory and the site is served under <http://localhost:1313> by default.

{{< mnote up=14 >}}
Hugo’s server can be specially configured to show a site on a public IP address. But it's **not** a full-fledged web server. The server is **only** meant for private previews. Theme templates may include conditional code for the server mode which could pose a security risk if shown in public.
{{< /mnote >}}

- The flag `-D` lets Hugo include **drafted** files. All files created with `hugo new` include `draft: true` in the front-matter. When a Markdown file is ready for [publishing](/doc/intro/workflow/publish), we need to remove this entry or change it to `draft: false`.

- The flag `--navigateToChanged` tells the server to relay the page of the last changed file to the browser. As soon as we save a content file the corresponding page pops up in the browser.

## Your first content

To generate a new blog entry use a command like

```sh {.left}
hugo new blog/first.md
```

The new file is created in the folder {$content/blog}. It has a front-matter section with some parameter keys for meta-data. They contain auto-generated values, or placeholders, or are empty.[^1] The first lines of the front-matter look like

```yaml {class="left" linenos=true }
---
author: 
title: First
date: 2022-07-01T21:22:27+02:00
```

The `author` value is optional, the `title` and the `date` are mandatory. The `title` is just guessed from the file name — you probably want to change it. The `date` contains the moment when we ran the `hugo new` command in a special format. You can also change it but need to be very careful.

At first, we ignore the following empty `resources` section and its parameters. We’ll [catch up later](/doc/intro/workflow/resources) with that.

```yaml {.left linenos=true linenostart=10}
categories: []
tags: []
draft: true
---
```

At the end of the front-matter are the taxonomy keys with empty lists (squared brackets) as values. You may want to add one or more comma-separated keywords.

Our Markdown content begins after the front-matter.

```text
**Placeholder**: Put your own summary paragraph here instead of this one.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->
```

All new files contain this placeholder with a special [attribute](/doc/attribute/howto) for the [first paragraph](/doc/page/standfirst) and the {$more} tag to mark this first paragraph as the page summary. You are encouraged to replace this placeholder with your summary now or later. It’s essential for cards and other page previews.

Your following content may be simple text without markup in the beginning.

As soon as you save your file, Hugo’s server will update your site in the browser. Should you make mistakes, Hugo will display a descriptive error message on its console or in the browser.

[^1]: The templates for the file generation with `hugo new` are part of the theme. But like any other theme template, we can override them. See the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) if you want to create your own.

## Editor usage

The following tips may improve your editing experience.

### Auto-save delay
Some editors are saving our work so fast by default, that nearly every keystroke leads to a new file version and the regeneration of the corresponding page. When we are in the process of changing sensitive content like front-matter parameters this can easily bring down Hugo’s server, because Hugo can’t process inconsistent files. 

Then, we have to restart the server, which is not a big deal but gets annoying after a while. It’s better to set the auto-save delay to a greater value, which lets us save consistent file versions manually.

### Editor links in the local preview

A few editors offer a protocol to open files with a special link. The theme provides a link to open the content file in a local instance of _Visual Studio Code_. This link is only present if Hugo runs in server mode. It’s placed in the date at the top or the bottom of regular pages. Because taxonomy pages don’t show a date, the link is placed in the title.

Links to other editors could be provided easily, too, if they offer this functionality.
