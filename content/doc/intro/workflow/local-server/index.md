While working on our content, we like to examine the result. To generate an immediate local preview, we run Hugo in server mode.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

The following short tutorial assumes, that you have opened a terminal and are in your project root containing a copy of this documentation project.

## Hugo’s server mode

```sh {.left-in}
hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
```

This command in the root of a project starts the [Hugo server][server]. All the HTML pages are rendered into memory and the site is served under <http://localhost:1313> by default.

{{< mnote up=14 >}}
Hugo’s server can be specially configured to show a site on a public IP address. But it's **not** a full-fledged web server. The server is **only** meant for private previews. The theme templates may include conditional code for the server mode which could pose a security risk if shown in public.
{{< /mnote >}}

- The flag `-D` lets Hugo include **drafted** files. All files created with `hugo new` include `draft: true` in the frontmatter. When a Markdown file is ready for [publishing](/doc/intro/workflow/publish), we need to remove this entry or change it to `draft: false`.

- The flag `--navigateToChanged` tells the server to relay the page of the last changed file to the browser. When we save a changed content file the corresponding page gets served in the browser.

## Your first content

To generate a new blog entry use a command like

```sh {.left-in}
hugo new blog/first.md
```

The new file is created in the folder {$content/blog}. It has a frontmatter section with some parameter keys for meta-data. They contain auto-generated values, or placeholders, or are empty.[^1] For our example we get:

```yaml {.left-in linenos=true }
---
authors: []
title: First
description: "**Placeholder**"
subtitle: false
date: 2023-11-15T14:05:45+01:00
categories: []
tags: []
draft: true
---
```

The `authors` value can be filled with one author or a comma-separated list of more people. The `title`, `date`, and `description` are mandatory entries. The auto-generated `title` is derived from the file name — you probably want to change it. The `date` contains the moment you ran the `hugo new` command. In case you change it, be very careful about preserving the special format. At last we have the taxonomy keys with their (empty) lists. You can add one or more keywords as (comma-separated) list into the squared brackets.

Our Markdown content begins after the frontmatter. All new files of this theme contain the following placeholder with a special [attribute](/doc/enhancing/attribute/howto) for the [first paragraph](/doc/page/standfirst) and the {$more} tag to mark this first paragraph as the page summary.

```text
**Placeholder**: Put your own summary paragraph here instead of this one.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->
```

This placeholder encourages you to always write a summary paragraph before publishing. It’s essential for cards and other page previews.

Other than this first paragraph, your normal content may be simple text without any markup or attributes.

As soon as you save your file, Hugo’s server will update your site in the browser. Should you make mistakes, Hugo will display a descriptive error message on its console or in the browser.

[^1]: The templates for the file generation with `hugo new` are called **archetypes** and part of the theme. But like any other theme template, we can override them. See the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) if you want to create your own.

## Editor usage

The following tips may improve your editing experience.

### Editor links in the local preview

A few editors offer protocols to open files with a special link. For now, the theme provides a link to open the content file in a local instance of Visual Studio Code. This link is only present if Hugo runs in server mode and a local file exists. It’s placed in the date at the top or the bottom of regular pages. On pages without a date, the link is placed in the title.

{{< mnote up=11 >}}
Hugo allows importing **remote content** as a module. In that case, there are no local files to open.
{{< /mnote >}}

### Auto-save delay
Some editors are auto-saving our work so fast by default, that nearly every keystroke leads to a new file version and the regeneration of the corresponding page. When we are in the process of changing sensitive content like frontmatter parameters, this can easily cause Hugo’s server to throw an error, because Hugo can’t render inconsistent files.

This may not be a big deal at first but will get annoying after a while. It’s better to set the auto-save delay to a bigger value, which lets us save consistent file versions manually.
