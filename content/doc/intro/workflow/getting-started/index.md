Hugo, the world’s fastest static site generator is steadily gaining traction. Hugo provides a reliable production environment and allows to build fast and secure websites.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a single command line tool for macOS, Windows, Linux and BSD derivatives. Binaries for most operating systems and some containers are usually available within a day or a few after every minor release.

{{< mnote up=11 >}}
The [Hugo source](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) can be compiled on every machine with a recent [Go environment](https://go.dev).
{{< /mnote >}}

The [Hugo documentation site][hugodoc] addresses developers mostly and offers detailed information. With a good theme only a small part of this knowledge is necessary to produce a professional website.

## Install Hugo

Please follow the specific [installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for your operating system on the Hugo documentation site (the docs). Because Hugo is still evolving and Perplex may use recent features you should choose an installation, which is easy to update frequently.

## Get Perplex

When you start to get acquainted with Hugo or need examples of Markdown content for Perplex, you should simply get this documentation project. It’s licensed as Creative Commons [(CC-BY-SA 4.0)][cc], available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplexdoc) and ships with all the files for the documentation and a few examples the other kinds of content.

### The documentation project

The folders for the project site are a subset of the standard Hugo folders.

```sh {.right .lh15 .hide-mobile}
├── assets
├── config
├── content
└── static
```

{$assets}
: provides site wide resources to be processed by the theme (not many).

{$config}
: is the configuration folder with all site wide parameters for this project.

{$content}
: contains the Markdown files and their resources (mostly images). This is where you probably want to start looking.

{$static}
: hosts all directories or files without the need for processing. They are copied to the publication folder (default: public) as they are. At the moment this folder only includes one file.
{.dl-loose}

The reserved {$\_vendor} folder includes a recent copy of the Perplex theme. Its working as a module cache and should never be touched directly. The theme copy gets imported from there as long as we don’t retrieve it otherwise. Because of this cached copy, there is no need to install a Go environment in the beginning. Should you be interested in the the theme, you’re welcome at its own [repository](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex).

### Project configuration

All configuration options are listed in the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/). The examples therein are given for a **single configuration file** like {$config.yaml} in your project root directory.

The configuration for this project is using the alternative option of a **configuration directory** named {$config} with separate files for the configuration sections. For the growing number of options this arrangement is clearer. The top configuration file is still called {$config.yaml} the other ones are named like the section they contain.

{{< mnote up=17 >}}
**The section key** needs to be removed in configuration files for sections, because the name of the file already is the section key. When you adopt a configuration option from the Hugo docs for modular configuration files, you need to remove it. And should you copy a configuration option from a section in a config folder into a single {$config.yaml}, you need to add it again. Same goes for TOML and JSON.
{{< /mnote >}}

### Start a project from scratch

We create an empty new project with a command like

```sh {.left}
hugo new site mysite
```

and get the folder {$mysite} with all the standard folders.

```sh {.right .lh15 .hide-mobile .up-8}
├── archetypes
├── assets
├── config
├── content
├── layouts
├── static
└── themes
```

As Hugo themes usually do, Perplex includes its folders for {$archetypes}, {$assets}, {$layouts} and {$static}. The corresponding folders in the project root are only meant for additional material or modified templates to override the ones from the theme with the same name.

There are three ways to get a theme from a Git repository:

1. Download and unzip its compressed file package in the {$themes} folder. This is the fastest way and the best option for a try-out.

2. Clone it with [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) into the {$themes} folder. If you already are using Git for your project, you probably should clone the theme as a submodule. This is also the workflow to contribute to the development of a Hugo theme or module, because now you have the possibility to submit your own changes (**Caution**: Git submodules need some additional care.)

3. Import a theme as a Hugo module. You need a recent [Golang environment](https://go.dev) – Hugo modules rely on Go modules. The Hugo docs provide a [guide to this feature](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules). Once set up, Hugo modules are the best way to update themes or other external components, content etc. There is a simple example for a theme module in the file [{$module.yaml}](/doc/appendix/config/moduleyaml).

When you chose option 1. or 2., you need to tell Hugo to use the theme in the [config file](/doc/appendix/config/configyaml.md#8). With 3. (the module) you don’t. Hugo includes modules by default as themes.

## Having trouble with Hugo?

When you encounter problems specifically with Hugo and can’t find an answer in its [documentation][hugodoc], the [Hugo community](https://discourse.gohugo.io) will support you. Please search the forum archive, because most likely your problem has already been answered there. If you are confronted with a new problem, please read the guidelines **How to Request Help** at the top of the site first, before you submit your request. You may need to provide a (temporary) public repository to let people inspect your code in detail.

All problems with this theme or this documentation should be addressed in [their repositories](/doc/intro/perplex#trouble)!
