Two basic steps need to be taken to publish a static website: **Build & Deploy**. There are many ways to realize them.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

Many workflows for Hugo are mentioned in the section [Hosting & Deployment][hd] of its documentation. In all cases we need to set the parameter `baseURL` to the URL of our site in the main configuration file [{$config.yaml}]({{< relref "configyaml#6" >}}).

The following remarks will give you a first impression of two general ways to build & deploy.

## Use your own hardware

As long as you are the only one finalizing the content, it’s easy to stick to your own computer. To generate a complete version of the site, we run Hugo in its default **build mode** from the project root like this:

```md {.left}
hugo --minify
```

Hugo renders the site and writes the files by default into the folder `public`. You can upload its content directly to your provider. You may also transfer the files to a big provider with a **C**ontent **D**elivery **N**etwork (CDN) for minimal latency.

## Automated Build and Continuous Deployment

Special providers automate the build process with configurable virtual machines. This is very useful for teams in need of a reliable shared build environment. The provider gets access to the repository (usually Git based), automatically pulls new content and (re)builds the site. Some of them also own a CDN, which gets populated immediately afterwards.

This setup is also convenient for private sites and non-commercial projects as long as the commercial providers offer a free tier for personal or open-source use. Hugo is building sites so fast, you may well stay in their often generous limits.

### Caching resources {.h-p .h-warn}

is mandatory if you don’t want to waste your free build minutes or your money when building a larger site with this theme on commercial virtual machines. Many different versions of every image are generated by Hugo from your resources in the content. These processed files are always cached in the reserved {$resources} folder and need to be generated only once. But you need to make sure that this folder is stored between subsequent Hugo runs or enable another kind of caching mechanism.
