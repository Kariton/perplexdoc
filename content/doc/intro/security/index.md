Static websites based on _Markdown_ content are inherently very secure. And they are bullet-proof as long as the generating templates are and as long as authors can’t manipulate the generated HTML.

## Don’t allow raw HTML

It’s possible to allow raw HTML inside of Markdown. The benefit seems obvious: We could use missing HTML elements directly. But there are two good reasons, why _Goldmark_ discards all HTML in _Markdown_ by default:

1. The whole purpose of _Markdown_ is to get rid of coding HTML directly.

2. Markdown is meant to be an easy and _safe_ markup for working on text files.    Malicious code could be hidden in HTML.
