**Perplex** produces a typographic layout, that adapts responsively to every modern screen size. It’s designed for optimal legibility down to a view-port of 360 Pixels width.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

_Perplex_ has been build on the basis of the [**IBM Plex**][plex] font family and is best suited for technical content with mixed sections of text and code. The layout is vertically aligned to a **baseline grid**[^1] to introduce a comfortable rhythm. Horizontally it’s divided into evenly spaced columns — their number depends on the screen width. On larger screens (view-port &ge; 592px) the [**responsive design**][rd] is combined with [**view-port sized typography**][ptres]—a.k.a. _fluid typography_—to deliver a coherent layout.

The **Plex** font family includes fonts for oriental languages written from right to left and for asian sign languages (some are still projected). So far, _Perplex_ can't adapt to their needs, because I'm not acquainted with their layout habits.

_Perplex_ styles the HTML generated by _Hugo_ from _Markdown_ content and _YAML_ front-matter through templates. This documentation also is a continuous test for the style sheet and the templates — and a demonstration of their quality.

The stylesheet is intended for recent browsers used by around 95\% of the users in the world (as accounted by [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com)). The deprecated _Internet Explorer_ and _Opera Mini_ are not supported.

## Based on Standardized Markdown

The HTML for the content is generated by _Hugo_ from _CommonMark Markdown_ and extensions by _PHP Markdown Extra_ and _GitHub flavored Markdown (GFM)_.

_Markdown_ is simple and simply great. It allows authors to compose the structure of (web) pages with a few relatively intuitive markup characters in plain text files. These structured files are rendered into reliable and clean (HTML) code.

There are professional solutions for a CMS-like workflow with web-GUIs. But they require a lot of additional configuration and I haven’t tried them with _Perplex_.
{{< /sidenote >}}

Because _Markdown_ is so simple, the generated HTML remains limited. Most of the time that’s a good thing, because it’s therefor also predictable and easy to style. But sometimes the content begs for variations in the layout arrangement. _Perplex_ offers many styling options and provides a few additional layout elements.

## _Perplex_ Layout Features

[Attributes]({{< relref "attribute" >}})
: are HTML attributes in single curly braces placed after _Markdown_ elements. In _Perplex_ they mostly offer alternative styling options. They get introduced on the pages of the specific element, they allow to style, or in the chapter [Attributes]({{< relref "attribute" >}}) when they are of general use.

[Replacements]({{< relref "replace" >}})
: are shorthands in single curly braces. They refer to inline HTML elements, which are missing in _Hugo’s_ _Markdown_ renderer.

[Shortcodes]({{< relref "shortcode" >}})
: are enclosed in two curly braces and angle brackets — like `{{</* shortcode */>}}`. They place custom HTML in the rendered page and can take input parameters. They allow to introduce any HTML structure, but tend to get complicated. _Perplex_ includes some shortcodes, but only for those cases, where a _replacement_ or an _attribute_ is insufficient. If _Hugo_ already provides a built-in shortcode, its established syntax is preserved as good as possible.

## Structured by _YAML_

The complete navigation and all other page layout elements besides the content are controlled by meta-data _parameters_. This documentation relies on [_**Y**AML **A**in’t **M**arkup **L**anguage_](https://yaml.org) to format the data, because it’s well-known and has the widest support.

{{< sidenote up=14 >}}
_Hugo_ also processes meta-data formatted by _TOML_ and _JSON_ and allows to convert front-matter data between all three possible formats.

Site parameters
: for every _Hugo_ project are contained in the site-wide [configuration][conf].

Page parameters
: are set directly in the _Markdown_ text files. Every file starts with a _YAML_ front-matter block, which is enclosed by three dashes `---`.
{.dl-loose}

Despite its successfull efforts to make data-formatting as simple as possible, _YAML_ still needs to adhere to strict rules. This may be frustrating for beginners. _Perplex_ provides skeleton templates via _Hugo’s_ [`new` command][new]. It generates a working front-matter block filled with some reasonable auto-generated data for every type of content. The front-matter blocks for this documentation contain usually around 15 entries, and you probably have to change or add only a few of them in the beginning.

## In Case of Problems

When you encounter a bug in the layout, please have a look first at the existing [issues][issue] for this theme. And please create a new one, if it’s not already there.

[^1]: The concept for the baseline has been inspired by [Plumber][plumber]. Despite precise calculations is the vertical alignment sometimes a little of, noticeably on screens with a lower pixel density—usually desktop screens. All browser engines seem to face an inevitable trade-off between the quality of the font rendering and the precision of the line height.
