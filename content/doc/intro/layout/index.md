*_Perplex_* generates a typographic layout, that adapts responsively to the screen size. It’s designed for optimal readability down to a view-port of 360 Pixels width.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

_Perplex_ has been build on the basis of the [**IBM Plex**][plex] font family and is best suited for technical content with mixed sections of text and code. The layout is vertically aligned to a **baseline grid**[^1] to introduce a comfortable rhythm. Horizontally it’s divided into evenly spaced columns — their number depends on the screen width. On larger screens (view-port &ge; 592px) the [**responsive design**][rd] is combined with [**view-port sized typography**][ptres]—a.k.a. _fluid typography_—to ensure a coherent layout.

_Perplex_ styles the HTML generated by _Hugo_ from _Markdown_ content and the theme templates. This documentation also acts as a continuous test for the style sheet — and as a demonstration of its quality.

The *Plex* family includes fonts for languages written from right to left. So far, _Perplex_ can't adapt to their needs, because I'm not acquainted with their layout habits.

## Based on Standardized Markdown

The HTML for the content of the pages is generated by _Hugo_ from *Commonmark Markdown* and extensions by *PHP Markdown Extra* and *GitHub flavored Markdown (GFM)*.

_Markdown_ is simple and simply great. It allows authors to compose the structure of (web) pages with a few markup characters in plain text files. These structured files are rendered into reliable and clean HTML code. (More about _Markdown_ on the [next page]({{< relref "writing" >}}))

{{< sidenote up=14 >}}
There are solutions for a CMS-like workflow with GUIs and automated deployment. But they require additional configuration and I haven’t tried them with _Perplex_.

But because _Markdown_ is so simple, the generated HTML remains limited. _Perplex_ offers many additional options to allow for a more expressive styling. And it ships with a few additional layout elements.

## Layout Features

[Replacements]({{< relref "replace" >}})
: are shorthands in single curly braces. They refer to inline HTML elements, which are missing in _Hugo’s_ _Markdown_ renderer.

[Shortcodes]({{< relref "shortcode" >}})
: are enclosed in two curly braces and angle brackets — like `{{</* shortcode */>}}`. They place custom HTML in the rendered page and can take input parameters. They allow to introduce any HTML structure, but tend to get complicated. _Perplex_ includes some shortcodes, but only for those cases, where a *replacement* or an *attribute* is insufficient. If _Hugo_ already provides a built-in shortcode, its established syntax is preserved as good as possible.

[Attributes]({{< relref "attribute" >}})
: are HTML attributes in single curly braces placed after _Markdown_ elements. In _Perplex_ they mostly offer alternative styling options. They get introduced on the pages of the specific element, they allow to style, or in the chapter [Attributes]({{< relref "attribute" >}}) when they are of general use.

[Page elements]({{< relref "page" >}})
: the content of the various page elements — menus, featured images... — is determined by parameters in the site configuration or the front-matter of specific pages.

## In Case of Problems

When you encounter a bug in the layout, please have a look first at the existing [issues][issue] for this theme. And please create a new one, if it’s not already there.

[^1]: The concept for the baseline has been inspired by [Plumber][plumber]. Despite precise calculations is the vertical alignment sometimes a little of, noticeably on screens with a lower pixel density—usually desktop screens. All browser engines seem to face an inevitable trade-off between the quality of the font rendering and the precision of the line height.
