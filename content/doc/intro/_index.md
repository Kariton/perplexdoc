**Perplex** has been designed to publish information about software. It provides templates for a documentation with up to three section levels, a news blog, longer articles and simple pages. The layout is optimized for strongly structured text mixed with code. The content resides in plain directories filled with **Markdown** files and supplemental resources. The Markdown files start with a front-matter section for the meta-data, which is used to build the navigation and all the other page elements.
