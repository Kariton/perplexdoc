## Resolve internal URLs

To refer to a page on our site we can include the URL into a [link]({{< relref "link" >}}) like any other. But it's often long and when our content grows and evolves, the path may change. Therefore, we better leave the resolution to _Hugo_ by using an unambiguous name for the page.{^*}

{{< sidenote star=1 up=9 >}}
If the name of a page is not unique, we still need to fill in the full path.
{{< /sidenote >}}

To replace unique names with URLs, _Hugo_ provides `relref` or `ref`. Internal links with these shortcodes look like

```md
[Link]({{</* relref "link" */>}})
[Introcuction]({{</* ref "intro" */>}})
```

`relref`
: returns the relative URL of the page, which is usually the better option. _Perplex_ then can distinguish between internal and external URLs and style the links with two different colors.

`ref`
: returns always the absolute URL of the page, which may be necessary under special circumstances.
{.dl-loose}

## Show a figure {#figure}

_Markdown_ contains no element, that gets rendered into a figure, because this is a task beyond simple markup. Therefore, _Hugo_ includes the `figure` shortcode with many options and the possibility to add styling classes. The resulting HTML includes just the original image, because the internal shortcode is a minimal default and meant to be overridden by theme developers with their specific version.

_Perplex_ does override the built-in `figure` shortcode with its own, but the variables are kept in place. There are no adjustments necessary. Additional options are presented on the page for the theme [`figure`]({{< relref "figure" >}})

## `highlight` Code

The highlight shortcode is complex and may use some additional CSS files.

{{< highlight html >}}
<section id="main">
  <div>
   <h1 id="title">{{ .Title }}</h1>
    {{ range .Pages }}
        {{ .Render "summary"}}
    {{ end }}
  </div>
</section>
{{< /highlight >}}

### Get parameters with `param`

We can show a configuration parameter in the content with this shortcode. Their values always get converted to a string:

- The title of this page with `{{</* param title */>}}` as “{{< param title >}}”.

- The parent of the menu entry with `{{</* param menu.doc.parent */>}}` as “{{< param menu.doc.parent >}}”.

- The featured image with `{{</* param featImg */>}}` as “{{< param featImg >}}”. In this case `param` shows the **site parameter**, because there is no such entry in the front-matter of this page.
