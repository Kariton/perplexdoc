A side-note contains information, that is not vital for the meaning of the main text, but may be helpful for its understanding. It explains context, sheds light on a detail etc.
{.p-first}

A side-note should accompany but not interrupt the text. If the screen is big enough, it is placed at right margins in the vicinity of its reference. On small screens it is placed before the following paragraph.

Because a long note would interrupt the reading flow on mobile screens, it is partly hidden and can be made fully visible by touch or click.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.

On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.
