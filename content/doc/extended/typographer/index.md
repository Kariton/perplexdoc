Simple ASCII punctuation characters are substituted with typographical glyphs.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

The concept for _Typographer_ follows the [Smartypants](https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) project from John Gruber, who also started Markdown. Convenient typing options should encourage the use of good typography.

The same results could also be achieved by using the _Unicode characters_ or _HTML entities_, but they are difficult to use. These are the substitutions the _Typographer_ offers:

| Element       |   ASCII          |  Result   |
| :------------ | :--------------: | :-------: |
| Quotes        |    `"Quote"`     |  "Quote"  |
| Single quotes |    `'Quote'`     |  'Quote'  |
| Apostrophe    |     `Hugo's`     |  Hugo's   |
| Angled quotes |   `<<Angle>>`    | <<Angle>> |
| Em Dash       |      `---`       |   ---   |
| En Dash       |       `--`       |    --     |
| Ellipses      |      `...`       |    ...    |
