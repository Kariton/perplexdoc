**PHP Markdown Extra** and **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)** offer some widely used extensions to the basic **Commonmark** syntax.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

Some of these extensions have already been discussed:

Linkify
: renders URLs in _Markdown_ automatically into links â€” the easiest way to [reference URLs]({{< relref "link#linkify" >}}).

Typographer
: substitutes ASCII punctuation characters with typographic glyphs. The substitution of quotation marks is a topic [on the quote page]({{< relref "quote#inline-quotes" >}}).
{.dl-loose}

All extensions are enabled in Hugo by default. You can disable them separately in the configuration file [`markup.yaml`]({{< relref "markup#8" >}}).
