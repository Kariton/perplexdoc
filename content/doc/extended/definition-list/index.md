Definition lists consist of **terms** as list markers, which are associated with **details** in the list entries.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

The definition list is an essential tool to structure textual content on a small scale. There is only one syntax, but _Perplex_ offers many styling options.  

## Syntax

```md
First Term
: Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and 
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
: Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

Second Term or
Second Term Alternative
: Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
```

Every list item begins with one or more _terms_. The lines after them contain the _description(s)_ starting with a colon followed by a space. An empty line between the list items is mandatory.

## Layout

The layout has to consider the length and number of all the components. The _standard_ version is working with every combination of terms and descriptions the additional options are not. The _tight_ style suits single terms with details, which do usually not exceed one line on larger screens. The _loose_ style is intended for single terms with long details.

### Standard

The standard layout resembles the default style of common browsers:

First Term
: {{< farfarshort 1 >}}
: {{< farfarshort 1 >}}

Second Term or
Second Term Alternative
: {{< farfarshort 1 >}}
{.box}

This style looks especially well for long terms in a literature list:

Horkheimer, Max und Theodor W. Adorno
: _Dialektik der Aufklärung: Philosophische Fragmente_. 18\. Aufl. Frankfurt am Main: Fischer Taschenbuch Verl., 2009.

Wiener, Norbert
: _Kybernetik: Regelung und Nachrichtenübertragung im Lebewesen und in der Maschine_. Econ classics. Düsseldorf: ECON-Verl., 1992.
{lang="de", .box}

### Tight

For a list with short single terms and only one short definition, a tighter style is more suitable. We apply it with the [attribute]({{< relref "attribute" >}}) `{.dl-tight}`:

First
: Far far away, behind the word mountains...

Second
: There live the blind texts.
{.dl-tight, .box}

### Loose

Short single terms with long descriptions will look better with a loose style, that is applied by the [attribute]({{< relref "attribute" >}}) `{.dl-loose}`

First Term
: {{< farfarshort 1 >}}
: {{< farfarshort 1 >}}

Second Term
: {{< farfarshort 1 >}}
{.dl-loose, .box}
