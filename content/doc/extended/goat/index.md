GoAT renders ASCII diagrams as SVG and is an implementation of Markdeepâ€™s ASCII renderer. I became a part of Hugo recently.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

[Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) provides a documentation for creating ASCII diagrams. We need to surround them with a [fenced code block]({{< relref "doc/basic/code#code-block" >}}) and the language identifier `goat` like this:

{{< playground "and the ASCII gets rendered into a nice SVG-diagram:" >}}

```goat
                  _______
.---------.      /      /    .-----.
|  Write  +-+-->/ Edit +-+->| Share |
'---------' ^  /______/  |   '-----'
            |            |
             '----------'
```

The font layout of GoAT is hard-coded into the Diagram-Editor. If the feature is getting used a lot with this theme, the text layout should get enhanced.
