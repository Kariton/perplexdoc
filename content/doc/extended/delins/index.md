Correction marks highlight changes while working on a draft. Lately, strike-through has also become a hip visual style.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

To visually record important changes in our text, we can expressively cancel a part of the previous version by marking it ~~strike-through~~. The opposite action is to mark a part as {+inserted} later.
{#layex}


## Syntax

Strike-through is applied by surrounding text with two swung dashes on every side like `~~deletion~~`. There is no Markdown syntax for an insertion available for Hugo, but you can use the [replacement code](/doc/enhancing/replace) with the plus sign like `{‚Äç+insertion}`.

## Layout

See the [second paragraph](#layex).

Consider that these markings tend to look unprofessional on a finalized page if it's not some kind of draft or change log.
