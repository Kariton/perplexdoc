Correction marks highlight changes while working on a draft. Lately, strike-through has also become a hip visual style.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

To visually record important changes in our text, we can expressively cancel a part of the previous version by marking it ~~strike-through~~. The opposite action is to mark a part as {+inserted} later.
{#layex}

The extension _strike-through_ has been introduced by [GitHub](https://github.com), because a hell of a lot collaborative work is going on there. On a finalized page it tends to look unprofessional if it's not some kind of change-log.

## Syntax

Strike-through is applied by surrounding text with two swung dashes on every side like `~~deletion~~`. There is no Markdown syntax for an insertion available in Hugo (yet), but you can use the [replacement code]({{< relref "replace" >}}) with the plus sign like `{‚Äç+insertion}` .

## Layout

See the [second paragraph]({{< relref "#layex" >}}).
