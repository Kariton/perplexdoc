A task list on a web page should be an interactive element with a connection between user input and the _Markdown_. _Perplex_ can't establish such a connection.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

The task list element is a _GitHub_ specialty. _GitHub_ has established a bidirectional connection between the view in the browser and the hosted Markdown files.

## Syntax

```md
- [x] First entry of a task list, which has already been completed.
- [ ] Second entry
- [ ] Third entry
```

## Layout
The task list gets rendered into a static list with inactive input elements. By the time of this writing the resulting HTML is not properly styled:

- [x] First entry of a task list, which has already been completed.
- [ ]  Second entry
- [ ]  Third entry

{{< sidenote up=11 >}}
With the coming CSS parent selector `:has` it should be easy to use the checkboxes as list markers and style the task list in a better way.
{{< /sidenote >}}
