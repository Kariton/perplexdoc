A task list on a web page should be an interactive element which directly changes the corresponding Markdown. A theme can't establish such a connection on its own.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

The task list element is a GitHub specialty. GitHub has established a bidirectional connection between the view in the browser and its hosted Markdown files.

Without that, we can still use the Markdown task list, but we can change it only in the content file.

## Syntax

```md
- [x] First entry of a task list, which has already been completed.
- [ ] Second entry
- [ ] Third entry
```

## Layout
The task list gets rendered into a static list with inactive input elements. By the time of this writing the resulting HTML is not properly styled:

- [x] First entry of a task list, which has already been completed.
- [ ]  Second entry
- [ ]  Third entry

{{< mnote up=11 >}}
With the coming CSS parent selector {$:has} it should be easy to use the checkboxes as list markers and style the task list in a better way.
{{< /mnote >}}
