The main text column offers space for {$80} characters of code in one line. When we need {$120} to fit in one line, we can choose to additionally use the marginal column.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

Short snippets of code are usually placed **in line** with the normal text. Longer pieces of code or entire files should be embedded as **code blocks**.

Hugo can style and colorize code blocks according to their content with the built-in _Chroma highlighter_ and offers some options to style these blocks.

## Syntax

### Inline Code

A code snippet is surrounded by single backticks like `` `code` ``.

### Code Block

We have two ways to mark a block as code:

Fenced
: When a block is surrounded by three back-ticks `` ``` `` in the line above and beyond it's a **fenced code block**.

Indented
: A block of text indented by 4 spaces or a tab is also treated as a **code block**.
{.dl-loose}

The **fenced** version of the CommonMark syntax is **preferable** for two reasons:

1. The following styling options are only available for fenced blocks:

   1. Code highlighting

   2. Line numbers

   3. Line markers

   4. Line anchors
   {.col2-l2}

2. There is an overlap with the syntax for the extensions [footnote][ftn] and [definition-list][dl]. When we have subsequent paragraphs there, we need to indent them also by 4 spaces or a tab. If we try to place an indented code block after a footnote reference or a definition detail, Hugo will treat it as this kind of continuation indent and not as a code block.
   {#overlap}

### Highlighting

Chroma can highlight many languages, when we add their usual file suffixes. The Hugo docs include the full list of available [languages][hugochroma].

### Additional styling for fenced code blocks

In contrast to other block elements the attributes follow the **first fence** of the code block on the same line after a space, like `` ```md {linenos=true}``.

The options suitable for Perplex are:

`linenos`
: Enables or disables line numbers. They are disabled by default [for this project](/doc/appendix/config/markup#40) --- enable them with `linenos=true`.

`hl_lines`
: Especially highlights some code lines. The lines must be given as a set of numbers or ranges enclosed in square brackets. Every range has to be surrounded additionally by quotes: `hl_lines=[2,"5-7"]`.

`linenostart`
: Lets the line numbers begin with a given number, like `linenostart=23`

`lineanchors`
: Adds a prefix to the anchors on the line numbers. With `lineanchors=prefix` for example the anchors are named `prefix-1`, `prefix-2`, ...
{.dl-loose}

## Layout

### Inline

The HTML tag to mark the beginning of code is `<code>`. And to mark the end we use the corresponding closing tag `</code>`. Markdown text surrounded by backticks like `` `text` `` gets enclosed by these tags.

### Block

There are a lot of options.

#### Without line numbers

```md
The *HTML* tag at the **beginning** of code is `<code>`.
And to mark the **end** we use the corresponding closing tag `</code>`.
```

#### With line numbers (table layout)

```md {linenos=true}
The *HTML* tag at the **beginning** of code is `<code>`.
And to mark the **end** we use the corresponding closing tag `</code>`.
```
#### Special sizes

For code examples with long lines, we can expand the block into the margin:

```go {class=large linenos=true}
// NodeRendererFunc is a function that renders a given node.
type NodeRendererFunc func(writer util.BufWriter, source []byte, n ast.Node, entering bool) (ast.WalkStatus, error)

// A NodeRenderer interface offers NodeRendererFuncs.
type NodeRenderer interface {
 // RendererFuncs registers NodeRendererFuncs to given NodeRendererFuncRegisterer.
 RegisterFuncs(NodeRendererFuncRegisterer)
}
```

When all code lines are no longer than 40 characters, we can place them inside or beside the text:

```json {.left linenos=true}
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 35,
  "profession": "Last Man Standing"
}
```

{{< farfar 1 >}}

```bash {.lh15 .right}
├── assets
├── config
├── package.json
├── public
├── resources
└── themes
```

{{< farfar 1 >}}

### Indented

    The _HTML_ tag at the **beginning** of code is `<code>`.
    And to mark the **end** we use the corresponding closing tag `</code>`.
