Sometimes we like to begin a new line without starting a whole new text block. To place such a **hard line break** gets complicated, when **hard line wraps** limit the line length in our file.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

## Syntax

There are two ways to place _intentional_ hard line breaks, which depend on the way we handle _hard line wraps_.

Commonmark
: allows _hard wraps_ — a.&hairsp;k.&hairsp;a. _hard line breaks_ — to limit the line length in _Markdown_ files. They are treated just like spaces. Therefore, _Commonmark_ needs a special syntax element for an _intentional_ line break.

GitHub
: instead treats hard line breaks simply as such. In this case we probably need to use _soft wraps_ in our editor to limit the line length, which may be a good habit anyway. (See also: [Writing Markdown][hwl])
{.dl-loose}

### The Commonmark way

_Hugo’s_ standard configuration is fully _Commonmark_-compliant, the parameter `hardWraps` is set to `false` by default. There are two ways now, to place an intentional line break:

Two spaces
: before the end of a line.

One backslash
: directly after the text and before the end of the line.
{.dl-loose}

Both options are unfortunately error-prone. _Spaces_ before the end of the line are usually invisible in text editors and get easily deleted by accident. The _backslash_ is visible, but if there is additional space between the backslash and the invisible newline character, the `\` is treated literally and shown on the resulting web page.

### The GitHub way

To follow _GitHubs_ way, we need to set `hardWraps` to `true`, as in the [configuration for this project][hw]. The syntax becomes intuitive:

Hard line breaks
: break the lines hard.
{.dl-loose}

### What now?

When you have to strictly adhere to the _Commonmark specification_ the best option from my point of view is still, to forgo hard wraps in your files and use the _Commonmark_-breaks. This way is compatible with _Commonmark_ **and** the _GitHub_ specification.

When you are allowed to deviate from _Commonmark_ in regard to this one element, I strongly recommend the _GitHub_ way. (See also: [Writing Markdown][hwl])

## Layout

_Hugo_ still recognizes the _Commonmark_-breaks, when `hardWraps` is set to `true`.

### Line Break {.h-p}

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.
