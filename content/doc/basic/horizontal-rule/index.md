Sometimes the separation of page segments by space is not clear enough. Then we add this layout element as an explicit visual separation.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

## Syntax

```md {.left}
*** or ---
```

The horizontal rule is depicted by three asterisks or three hyphens at the beginning of a line. Up to three spaces are allowed for indentation. No other characters are allowed to follow on the same line.

## Layout

{{< farfarshort 1 >}}  

***

{{< farfarshort 1 >}}
