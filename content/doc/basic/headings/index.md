Headings introduce and order the segments on a page. On a website with many pages, each level should have similar importance.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

## Syntax

Markdown headings are preceded by number signs `#` and a space. The six available headings are associated with the following meaning in Perplex:

1. `# Page Title`&emsp;{s [**Not needed**][anchor] on standard Perplex pages!}

2. `## Section Heading`

3. `### Subsection Heading`

4. `#### Sub-Subsection Heading`

5. `##### Paragraph Heading`

6. `###### Small Paragraph Heading`

Usually we don’t want to apply the full hierarchy on moderate sized pages, because too much structure is confusing. For an appropriate layout, it may be desirable to skip one or two levels and use paragraph headings inside of sections for example.

But this is against recommended HTML guidelines. Headings should be used strictly in their descending order, because screen readers and other automatic interpreters get confused otherwise. To follow this recommendation we need to skip headings visually.

Another variation of their style is to highlight them. Its an easy way to inform readers about especially important text segments.

For these style variations Perplex offers Markdown [attributes][attr].

### Paragraph Headings {#h-p}

We can style any heading like a paragraph heading with the attribute `{.h-p}`. For the probably rare occasions we need to style a heading as a small paragraph heading we need an additional attribute: `{.h-p .h-p-s}`.

### Special Headings

To highlight some **warning**, an important **information** or **tip**, we have the attributes `{.h-warn}`, `{.h-info}` or `{.h-tip}`.

A warning paragraph for example starts with a heading like this:

```md
##### Warning Paragraph {.h-warn}
Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and…
```

#### Beware {.h-warn .h-p}
This special linebreak replacement is only needed in headings or titles, because they can’t be wrapped in Markdown. Otherwise Markdown [can handle them]({{< relref "doc/basic/linebreak" >}}).

## Layout

Headings are not only recognized by their font styling but also by the white-space surrounding them. That's why the following examples are shown in the way they usually appear: In front and in between some text.

***

# Page Title {.mt3 .mb3 #title}

If the page already has a title, the first heading **should not** occur in the Markdown content. Like many themes Perplex provides titles for all pages.

{{< mnote up=8 >}}
The [page title]({{< relref "doc/page/title" >}}) is generated from parameters in the front-matter.
{{< /mnote >}}

We still may need the first heading on special pages without a title section, when we want to compose a title in the Markdown content.

## Section Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

### Subsection Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

#### Sub-Subsection Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

#### Styled Paragraph Heading {.h-p}
{{< farfar 1 >}}

#### Warning Paragraph {.h-warn .h-p}
{{< farfar 1 >}}

##### Info Paragraph {.h-info}
{{< farfar 1 >}}

##### Tip Paragraph {.h-tip}
{{< farfar 1 >}}

###### Small Paragraph Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

[anchor]: {{< relref "#title" >}}
[attr]: {{< relref "doc/attribute" >}}
