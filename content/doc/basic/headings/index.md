Headings introduce and order content segments on a page. Heading levels need to descend without interruption. We can modify headings only visually when we want to skip some levels.

## Syntax

Markdown headings are preceded by number signs `#` and a space. The six available headings are associated with the following meaning in Perplex:

1. `# Page Title`&emsp;**{s [Usually not available](#page-title)!**}

2. `## Section Heading`

3. `### Subsection Heading`

4. `#### Sub-Subsection Heading`

5. `##### Paragraph Heading`

6. `###### Small Paragraph Heading`

To alter the style of these headings, Perplex offers a few special Markdown [attributes][attr].

### Visual paragraph headings {#h-p}

On moderately sized pages, we usually don’t want to apply the full heading hierarchy because too much structure is as confusing as too little. We may like to skip one or two levels and use paragraph headings in normal sections for example.

However, this would violate official HTML guidelines and mess up the table of contents (TOC). Heading tags always need to descend strictly also because screen readers and other automatic interpreters get confused otherwise.

To abide by this rule, we can skip headings only visually. Any heading does look like a paragraph heading with the attribute `{.h-p}` or `{.h-p-s}` for a small paragraph heading.
{.inline}

### Highlighted headings

To emphasize especially important text segments, we can start them with a highlighted heading. This is a more subtle option than [annotation boxes](/doc/enhancing/attribute/box).

To mark a section about some **danger**, **warning**, **information**, or **success**, we apply the attributes `{.h-danger}`, `{.h-warn}`, `{.h-info}`, or `{.h-success}`.

A warning paragraph for example starts with a heading like this:

```text
##### Warning Paragraph {.h-warn}
{{% pangram 1 %}}
```

### Very long headings with complicated topics stretching over more than one line

CommonMark offers no possibility to break a heading line because every line starting with the number sign `#` starts a new heading.

When a heading exceeds the line length of the layout, it automatically reflows into the next line. That may occur at an unfortunate place: Before the last word or between tightly related words. To introduce a manual break of our own choosing we can put the replacement code `{‍/}` between two words **without any spacing character** like this:

```text {.expand}
### Nice long heading with a complicated topic{‍/}stretching over more than one line
```

and we get:

### Nice long heading with a complicated topic{/}stretching over more than one line

This line break is displayed only when the viewport allows for the full-text width. On small screens, the manual break is hidden, because manual line breaks tend to come out even worse on small viewports with additional automatic breaks.

## Layout

Headings are not only recognized by their font styling but also by the space surrounding them. That's why the following examples are shown in the way they usually appear: In front and in between some text.

***

# Page Title {.mt3 .mb3}

The first heading is reserved for titles. Only one `<h1>` tag should occur on any webpage. We may want to compose a title in Markdown on special pages but in all theme templates, the [title section](/doc/page/title) is rendered from meta-data in the frontmatter.
{.box-warn}

## Section
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

### Subsection
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

#### Sub-Subsection
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

##### Paragraph
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

###### Small paragraph
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

#### Paragraph attribute {.h-p}
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

#### Danger {.h-danger .h-p}
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

#### Warning {.h-warn .h-p}
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

#### Info {.h-info .h-p}
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}

#### Success {.h-success .h-p}
{{% pangram 4 %}}
{.placeholder data-pagefind-ignore="all"}
