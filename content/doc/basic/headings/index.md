Headings introduce and order the segments on a page. On a website with many pages, each level should have similar importance.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

## Syntax

_Markdown_ headings are preceded by number signs `#` and a space. The six available headings are associated with the following meaning in _Perplex_:

1. `# Page Title`&emsp;{s[**Not needed**][anchor] on standard _Perplex_ pages!}

2. `## Section Heading`

3. `### Subsection Heading`

4. `#### Sub-Subsection Heading`

5. `##### Paragraph Heading`

6. `###### Small Paragraph Heading`

Usually we donâ€™t apply the full hierarchy on moderate sized pages, because too much structure is confusing. And we may skip some levels and use paragraph headings inside of sections for example.

### Special Headings

When we want to highlight a heading, that contains some *warning* or an important *information* or *tip*, we can use these [attributes][attr]: `{.h-warn}`, `{.h-info}`, `{.h-tip}`

A warning paragraph starts with a heading like this:

```md
##### Warning Paragraph {.h-warn}
Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
```

## Layout

Headings are not only recognized by their font styling, but also by the white-space surrounding them. That's why the following examples are shown the way they usually appear: In front and in between some text.

***

# Page Title {.h-info #title}

If the page already has a title, the first heading **should not** occur in the _Markdown_ content. Like many themes _Perplex_ provides titles for all pages.

{{< sidenote up=9 >}}
The title is generated from parameters in the front-matter. (See [title]({{< relref "title" >}}))
{{< /sidenote >}}

We still may need the first heading on special pages without a title section, when we want to compose a title in the _Markdown_ content.

## Section Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

### Subsection Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

#### Sub-Subsection Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

##### Paragraph Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

##### Warning Paragraph {.h-warn}
{{< farfar 1 >}}

##### Info Paragraph {.h-info}

{{< farfar 1 >}}

##### Tip Paragraph {.h-tip}
{{< farfar 1 >}}

###### Small Paragraph Heading
{{< farfar 1 >}}

[anchor]: {{< relref "#title" >}}
[attr]: {{< relref "attribute" >}}
