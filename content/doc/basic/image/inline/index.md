The theme embeds an inline Markdown image by default **as a float** in the containing block.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

This page contains demonstrations of the layout for embedded images. Their extended syntax is similar to the one for stand-alone images and is explained on the page about the [general image syntax](/doc/basic/image/syntax).

The most common place for an embedded image is **at the beginning** of a paragraph. But we may want to place images also **in the middle** of one or **inside of indented text** blocks.

## Default

The default size is the normal one placed on the left. Images without an entry in the front-matter should be used only at the beginning of text blocks. Registering an image as a [resource](/doc/intro/workflow/resources) opens many options. We can [add a caption](#normal) for example.

![Placeholder image](normal.svg) Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographical life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

## At the beginning

This is the most common place for an embedded image. By default its placed on the left, if the screen is wide enough.

{.blind .blind-right}

One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen.

## Indented text blocks

Embedded images take a fixed percentage of the width of the containing block: 

1. ![](tiny) Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

   - ![](tiny?posh=right) Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

   - ![](tiny) Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

2. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.  ![](tiny?posv=middle&posh=right) Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

### Full size {.clear}

Usually, we use a normal-sized stand-alone image to use the full width of the text. But they donâ€™t fit inside indented text blocks. Then, we can also place embedded images with the full width of the containing block like this:

1. Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts:
   ![](normal?size=full)

2. Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts:
   ![](normal?size=full)
{.box}

or this

1. Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts:
   ![](normal?size=full)

2. Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts:
   ![](normal?size=full)
{.col2 .box}
