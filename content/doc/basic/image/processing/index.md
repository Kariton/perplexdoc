The theme relies solely on Hugo’s image-processing capabilities.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

Many different-sized versions of every image are generated automatically, so every client browser finds a near-optimal size to display. We only need to supply an original image which is large enough for the intended layout.

## Resolution

For crisp images on high-density screens, we should at least provide images for double-density.

| Image type | 2&times;density | 3&times;density |
|:-----------|:-------:|:-----:|
| block (default) | {{< width/measure 2 >}} | {{< width/measure 3 >}} |
| large block | {{< width/measure 3 >}} | {{< width/measure 4.5 >}} |
| extra-large block | {{< width/measure 4 >}} | {{< width/measure 6 >}} |
| embedded (default) \& small block | {{< width/column 2 >}} | {{< width/column 3 >}} |
| small embedded | {{< width/column 1 >}} | {{< width/column 1.5 >}} |

When we build a project with more than a hundred images — like this project — we have to show a little patience on the first Hugo run. Image processing may take a few minutes. The generated images are cached by Hugo and we don’t have to wait again in subsequent runs.

{{< mnote up=14 >}}
On **virtual machines** we should enable a caching mechanism. If the provider pulls the content from a repository, we can include the reserved {$_resources} folder, where processed files are stored.
{{< /mnote >}}

In case we can’t provide a large enough version of an image, Perplex uses an [excellent interpolation filter][filter] provided by Hugo to enlarge its size smoothly. Those interpolated images may look blurry nonetheless, there is no way to get missing information back. A high resolution of the original is always preferable.

## Manipulation

### TODO

- Improve templates
- Document resource parameters
