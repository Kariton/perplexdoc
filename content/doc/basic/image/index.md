Perplex handles all Markdown images by default as floats inside a text block. Self-contained separate images are the domain of the {$figure} shortcode. But there is a fallback for the widespread self-contained use of Markdown images.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

## Syntax

Embedding an image is syntactically similar to placing a [link]({{< relref "doc/basic/link" >}}). The sole difference: The image element begins with an exclamation mark`!`.

### Short inline notation

 ```md {.left}
 ![Alternative Text](image.jpg)
 ```

The alternative text inside the square brackets `[]` is used by screen readers, pure text browsers and all kinds of data scrapers.

{{< mnote up=11 >}}
Perplex also allows to specify an `alt` parameter in the resource meta-data, when we reference an image there. In that case, we have two options: We can leave the brackets empty or override this resource parameter.
{{< /mnote >}}

### Reference notation

We can use a marker in a second pair of squared brackets to separate the image reference:

```md {.left}
![Name][imgref]
```

We have to provide the image reference somewhere else in the same file by repeating the marker followed by a colon and a space before the path:

```md
[imgref]: long/path/to/image.jpg "Optional Title"
```

This syntax is especially convenient, when an image is used more than once or when a long path or title would clutter the content.

{{< mnote up=14 >}}
**The optional title** for an image gets displayed, when a mouse pointer hovers over the image. Consider that many touch-screen devices don't have one. The image title shouldn’t contain very important information.
{{< /mnote >}}

### Passing extra parameters

Markdown can’t handle more image parameters than the ones mentioned above. To offer layout variations, Perplex can handle additional parameters with the help of Hugo. All of them can be given as resource meta-data in the front-matter. Alternatively we can change some layout parameters directly in the Markdown by adding parameters to the image name.

#### Resource meta-data {#meta-data}

We can specify the following parameters with the given keys and types of values:

| Parameter | Key | Values |
|:---------|:----------|:---------|
| Alternative text | alt | Plain string |
| Attribution | attr | Inline Markdown string |
| Attribution link | attrlink | URL |
| Caption | caption | Inline Markdown string |
| Class | class | CSS class names |
| Link | link | URL |
| Horiz. position | posh | {{% parameters imaging.embedded.posh %}} |
| Vert. position | posv | {{% parameters imaging.embedded.posv %}} |
| Related | rel | See [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types) |
| Size | size | {{% parameters imaging.embedded.size %}} |
| Target | target | {{% parameters link.target %}} |

#### Adding parameters in-place

We can use a special syntax to set the few layout parameters, which tend to change more often in the process of content creation. The size and the position of an image can be specified like:

```md
![Alternative text](image.jpg?size=small&posh=right)
```

The start of every name extension is marked by an interrogation mark `?`. Then follows a short parameter key, the equal sign `=` and the parameter value. Consecutive key-value pairs are separated by an ampersand `&`.[^1]

{{< mnote up=17 >}}
The idea to use the well established syntax for query strings goes back to a suggestion by Joe Mooring in the Hugo forum.
{{< /mnote >}}

We can specify a few parameters to a given set of values:

| Parameter | Key | Values |
|:----|:----|:----|
| Size | size (s) | {{% parameters imaging.embedded.size %}} |
| Horiz. position | posh (ph) | {{% parameters imaging.embedded.posh %}} |
| Vert. position | posv (pv) | {{% parameters imaging.embedded.posv %}} |

##### The value `middle`
for the vertical positioning doesn’t move an embedded image into the middle of the block. Its only an indicator for the layout to add some additional space for images, which are already placed in the middle of a text block.

[^1]: The syntax for **query strings** has been introduced to extend URLs with optional parameters like `https://name.org?id=val&id2=val2`. They are usually generated automatically to specify API requests.

##### Overriding resource parameters {.h-info}

When the given parameters are already defined in the resource section of the front-matter, the in-place parameters will override them.

## Resolution

Perplex relies on Hugo’s image processing capabilities. Many different sized versions of every image are generated automatically, so every client browser can pick the optimal size to display. We only need to supply a large enough original image. For crisp images on high density screens we should at least provide images for double density display.

| Image type | 2&times;density | 3&times;density |
|:-----------|:-------:|:-----:|
| block | {{< width/measure 2 >}} | {{< width/measure 3 >}} |
| large block | {{< width/measure 3 >}} | {{< width/measure 4.5 >}} |
| extra-large block | {{< width/measure 4 >}} | {{< width/measure 6 >}} |
| embedded \& small block | {{< width/column 2 >}} | {{< width/column 3 >}} |
| small embedded | {{< width/column 1 >}} | {{< width/column 1.5 >}} |

{{< mnote up=20 >}}
When we build a project with more than hundred images — like this project — we have to show a little patience on the first Hugo run. Image processing may take a few minutes. The generated images are cached by Hugo and we don’t have to wait again in subsequent runs. For builds on virtual machines, we should enable a caching mechanism or include the reserved {$_resources} folder, where processed files are stored.
{{< /mnote >}}

In case we can’t provide a large enough version of an image, Perplex uses an [excellent interpolation filter][filter] provided by Hugo to enlarge its size smoothly. Those interpolated images may look blurry nonetheless, a high resolution of the original is always preferable.

## Layout

Perplex embeds every image **as a float** into the containing text block by default. The default is the most common choice **at the beginning** of the block. But we may want to place images also **in the middle**. In both cases following blocks may have to flow around the image, too, when the containing one is short.

### At the beginning

This is the most common place for an embedded image. By default its placed on the left, if the screen is wide enough.

## Fallback to full width {#fallback}

When your content already relies on self-contained Markdown images, it will take some time to restructure them. Because their default layout in Perplex will be broken—the default layout is only half the size of the main text column—we have a fallback.

{{< mnote up=14 >}}
A self-contained image element is treated by Markdown like a paragraph with the image as the sole content inside. The HTML `<img>`-tag is an inline element in need of a block element as container. When we use the [{$figure}-shortcode]({{< relref "figure" >}}) for self-contained images, we can also make them bigger than the main text column or place them on the sides.
{{< /mnote >}}

We can set the configuration parameter `embedFull` to `true` in the site configuration to use it for all images. We can also place this parameter in the front-matter of specific pages. Or we can set the size of a specific image to `full`, which is probably only useful for this demonstration:

```md
![A surreal colored corridor](efe-kurnaz-RnCPiXixooY-unsplash.jpg?size=full)
```
