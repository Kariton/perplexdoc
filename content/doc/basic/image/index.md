Markdown images should always be embedded in a text block for *_Perplex_* and are styled accordingly. self-contained images are the domain of the shortcode for a [figure]({{< relref "figure" >}}).
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

## Syntax

Embedding an image is similar to placing a [link]({{< relref "link" >}}). The key difference is: The image element begins with an exclamation mark!

### Short inline notation

 ```md {.left}
 ![Name](path/to/image.jpg)
 ```
The *name* of the image element inside the square brackets `[]` is used as alternative text[^1] in case the browser can't display the image.

This syntax is preferable when the path is short — like the one for an image in a [_Hugo_ page bundle]({{< relref "hugo#bundle" >}}).

### Reference notation

As for [links]({{< relref "link" >}}) we can use a marker in a second pair of squared brackets to separate the image reference:

```md {.left}
![Name][imgref]
```
We have to provide the image reference somewhere else in the same file by repeating the marker followed by a colon and a space before the path:

```md
[imgref]: long/path/to/image.jpg "Optional Title"
```
This syntax is especially convenient, when an image is used more than once or when a complicated path or a long title would clutter the other content.

{{< sidenote up=14 >}}
###### The optional title
for an image gets displayed, when a mouse pointer hovers over the image. Consider that many touch-screen devices don't have one.
{{< /sidenote >}}

### Block Attributes

| Attribute      | Mobile | Tablet  |
|:---------------|:-------|:--------|
| default (left) |        |         |
| .i-right       |        |         |
| .i-midst      |        |         |
| .i-small       |        |         |
| .i-tiny        |        |         |

## Image resolution

_Perplex_ relies on _Hugo’s_ image processing capabilities to generate differently sized versions of every image. Thereby, every browser can pick the smallest sufficient size based on the actual width of the image and the pixel density of the actual screen.

For good results, the original images should have a width of at least {{< imagewidth 2 >}} to allow double density on screens with a high resolution.



## Layout

First, copies with different sizes are generated for the given image. They are all placed with the `srcset`-attribute inside the `<img>`-tag and to be at the disposal of the browsers. Based on the actual size of the image and the device resolution, every browser can download the optimal version.{^\*}

_Perplex_ embeds every image **as a float** into the containing paragraph. The most obvious place is *at the beginning* of paragraph. But we may want to place images also *in the middle* of a paragraph. In both cases following paragraphs may flow around the image, too, when the containing paragraph is not very long.

Because the image element is so easy to use, authors often include images self-contained {!*between paragraphs*}. This is a {!**problematic practice**}, because the image element will always be wrapped inside a paragraph in the resulting HTML.{^**} Therefore, the {!standard floating layout in _Perplex_ will be broken}.

{{< sidenote star=2 up=15 >}}
A self-contained image element is treated by _Markdown_ like a paragraph with the image as the sole content inside. The HTML `<img>`-tag is an inline element in need of a block element as container.
{{< /sidenote >}}

###### The best way {.h-tip}
to deal with self-contained images in _Perplex_ is to use the [*figure*-shortcode]({{< relref "figure" >}}), that includes the image. But for a quick and dirty solution you can apply the attribute `{.p-img-full}` after the image element.

### At the beginning of a paragraph

This is the most common place for an embedded image. By default its placed embedded on the left, if the screen is wide enough.
