To quote someone means to recognize her or his thoughts as part of our own. We may agree or disagree, but we should refer to them correctly.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

A single word or short piece of text is usually quoted in the running text and is called an **inline quote**. A longer text segment is usually quoted as separate block and called a **blockquote**.

Some quotes should attract immediate attention while scanning the page. These are **hero quotes** and Perplex provides the [attribute](/doc/attribute) `{.blockquote-hero}` to style them.

## Inline Quotes

Quotes in the running text just need to be enclosed by quotation marks.

When we type `“I quote you”` we simply get “I quote you”.
{.p-big}

But our keyboard usually doesn't show these typographically correct _curly_ quotation marks and we like to use the directly available straight ones, which get then replaced by our software.

### Substitution of English quotation marks

Hugo replaces the typographically dumb straight quotes with the correct curly ones by default — this is the responsibility of the  [typographer extension](/doc/extended/typographer). We can use {%"} — straight quotes — like this:

`"An inline quote"`&emsp;for&emsp;"An inline quote"
{.p-big}

And a single word or a quote inside a quote is marked with {%\'} — single straight quotes:

`"A quote 'inside'"`&emsp;for&emsp;"A quote 'inside'"
{.p-big}

### In French, Swiss. and German (partially)

We can open French and Swiss quotes with two {%<} angled brackets and close them with two {%>} in the other direction. They get replaced with nice guillemets (not guillemots!).

`<<Pardon my French>>`&emsp;for&emsp;<<Pardon my French>>
{.p-big}

In German publishing we usually find guillemets the other way around:

`>>Zahnstocher<<`&emsp;for&emsp;>>Zahnstocher<<
{.p-big}

We get into trouble with these, when we start a line with `>>`, because the `>` is also the sign for a [quotation block](#blockquote). We can begin the line with an invisible entity like the zero width joiner `&zwj;` for a quick workaround:

&zwj;>>Noch einen Zahnstocher, bitte!<<
{.p-big}

But now we miss out on the micro-typographic feature of [hanging quotes](#hanging-quotes).

### General Solutions

Because the typographer can't handle other languages, we need to think about a way to include them directly

Keyboard Shortcuts
: We can learn key combinations to include often needed punctuation. Unfortunately, they depend on the operating system and the keyboard layout. On some systems, they are relatively easy to remember, on others, they are practically useless. But you could give it at least a try and look them up for your configuration.

[HTML entities](/doc/basic/specialchar)
: We get the German _Gänsefüßchen_&ensp;&bdquo;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp; with `&bdquo;` and `&ldquo;` for example. Entities look weird in text files, but the result is as good as the original Unicode characters.
{.dl-loose}

{{< mnote up=12 >}}
It’s possible to replace them with Unicode characters and maybe your editor has a plugin for that.
{{< /mnote >}}

## Blockquote

Every line of a block quotation has to start with a **right angled bracket**, empty lines included:

```md
> Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow! The quick brown fox jumps over 
> the lazy dog. Waltz job vexed quick frog nymphs.
>
> A very big box sailed up then whizzed quickly from Japan. My faxed joke
> won a pager in the cable TV quiz show.
```

The result is an indented block with a slightly smaller font size and two paragraphs:

> Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Waltz job vexed quick frog nymphs.
>
> A very big box sailed up then whizzed quickly from Japan. My faxed joke won a pager in the cable TV quiz show.

Blockquotes may include additional markup because we need emphasis, inline quotes, links, footnotes, and other inline markup and maybe even lists inside quotations. The CommonMark specification allows using all elements of Markdown inside of a blockquote.

**But consider this in practice:** Nested block quotes or tables inside of block quotes? They would become an aesthetic nightmare! This theme does not support every possibility. Feel free to file an issue in the theme repository, if an essential option has no suitable layout.

## Hero quote

Because there is only one possible markup for blockquotes described above, we have to use the [attribute](/doc/attribute) `.blockquote-hero`: 

```md
> BlewJ’s computer quiz favored proxy hacking. Big July earthquakes confound
> zany experimental vow. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Show mangled
> quartz flip vibe exactly. Public junk dwarves quiz mighty fox.
> --- _Famous Person_
{.blockquote-hero}
```

to produce this layout:

> BlewJ’s computer quiz favored proxy hacking. Big July earthquakes confound zany experimental vow. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Show mangled quartz flip vibe exactly. Public junk dwarves quiz mighty fox.
> --- _Famous Person_
{.blockquote-hero}

## Hanging quotes

Micro-typography is usually missing on the web because browsers don’t support it. But hanging quotes at the beginning of a paragraph are possible! They are applied to English “quotes”, French «guillemets», »German guillemets«, and German „Gänsefüßchen“.

“This is a quote surrounded by English double quotes”

«Pardon my french»

»Könnte ich bitte einen Zahnstocher bekommen?«
{lang=de}

„Könnte ich bitte noch einen Zahnstocher bekommen?”
{lang=de}
