Sometimes we need to explicitly refer to the keyboard strokes needed to complete a task.

## Syntax

The replacement character `#` indicates a key legend. The replacement code `{‍#K}` for example shows the {#K}.  

## Layout

### Guillemets in Linux

The operating system Linux offers these simple keyboard shortcuts to introduce punctuation elements for French, Swiss and German typography.

{#Alt Gr} + {#Y}
: corresponds to the guillemet '»'

{#Alt Gr} + {#X}
: produces the guillemet '«'

{#Alt Gr} + {#Shift} + {#Y}
: gives us a single guillemet '›'

{#Alt Gr} + {#Shift} + {#X}
: produces '‹'

### Copy & Paste in Windows

The operating system _Windows_ allows copying a piece of text into the clipboard by typing {#Ctrl} + {#C}. To use the clipboard content in another location, we type {#Ctrl} + {#V}.
