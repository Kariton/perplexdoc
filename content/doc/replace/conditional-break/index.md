Sometimes we like to break a title or a line only for those layouts, which show the text in full width.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

## Syntax

The code `{‚Äç/}` is placed between the words to break **without additional spacing**.

## Layout

The layout changes depending on the viewport width. The break is only visible on larger screens.

### A compact heading{/}looks visually appealing
