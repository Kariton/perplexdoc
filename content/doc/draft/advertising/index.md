But I've also been working with two Markdown editors for special purposes and for other work unrelated to this project:

[Typora](https://typora.io)
: The software for Linux, macOS and Windows is still in a free beta testing phase, but working fine, mostly. It has a minimalistic *preview-editing mode* showing styled and editable Markdown in one window. And it provides an unmatched support for importing and editing tables.

[iA Writer](https://ia.net/de/writer)
: This editor for macOS, Windows, iOS and Android is a mature product with a focus on a convenient and efficient writing experience and printable results.
