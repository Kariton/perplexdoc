When the first paragraph contains a short introduction or summary of the page, the theme can apply a notably different style. And with the {$more} tag, we can mark it as the summary of the page.
{.p-first #first} <!--more-->

A lead paragraph is optional but strongly recommended. To encourage its use, every regular page file generated with `hugo new` contains a placeholder.

## Syntax
The [attribute](/doc/attribute) `{.p-first}` styles the paragraph. The more-tag `<!--more-->` marks the paragraph as the summary of the page which is displayed on cards and in content lists etc.

Hugo always generates a content summary if anyhow possible. But Hugo can’t analyze content, it just strips the first sentences (≈ 70 words) down to unformatted text. This may lead to badly truncated text and sometimes even to nearly incomprehensible results when these first lines have been strongly structured by markup.

## Result
The [first paragraph](#first) on this page is styled as stand-first.
