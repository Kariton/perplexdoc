When the first paragraph contains a short introduction or summary of the page, we can style it emphasized and provide it as meta-data for search optimization.
{.p-first #first} <!--more-->

A lead paragraph is optional, but to encourage its use, every file generated by `hugo new` with Perplex includes a placeholder.  

## Syntax
The [attribute](/doc/attribute) `{.p-first}` styles a paragraph emphasized. The additional _more tag_ `<!--more-->` marks the paragraph as meta-description of the page. Search engines and other automatic web crawlers may use it, to categorize the page and produce a preview. If we don’t need the special styling from `{.p-first}`, we can add the _more tag_ nonetheless.

{{< mnote up=17 >}}
**Hugo** always tries to generate a content summary, which can act as meta-description. But Hugo can’t analyze the content, it just strips the first sentences (≈ 70 words) of all markup. This usually leads to truncated text and sometimes even to nearly incomprehensible results, when these first words are strongly structured by a table or a list.
{{< /mnote >}}

## Result
The [first paragraph](#first) on this page is styled as lead paragraph. Because of an additional _more tag_ its contents also gets included with a `<meta>`-tag in the `<head>` of the HTML page:

```html
<meta name="description" content="When the first paragraph contains a short introduction or summary of the page, we can style it emphasized and provide it as meta-data for search optimization.">
```
