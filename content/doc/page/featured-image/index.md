Perplex presents this image at the top of your pages and in reference cards. Its also fed to search engines and social networks with the help of meta tags.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

## Syntax

To make the image file available inside of a [page bundle]({{< relref "doc/intro/workflow/content" >}}), it needs to be included in the resources section of the front-matter. The content file of this page for example contains the following section:

```yaml
resources:
  - src: ray-hennessy-gdTxVSAE5sk-unsplash.jpg
    name: featured
    params:
      alt: fireworks over open water
```

The image is identified by its reserved name `featured`. Only one featured image is allowed per page and it should be at least {${{< colwidth 3 >}}} wide.

If no featured image is given for a page, Perplex will search for one: First in its taxonomies (and there the tags have priority), then in its parent folder.
