Features, which I consider essential before a public release, and the ones which would be nice to have.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

## Essential

Author pages
: an {$authors} taxonomy with a special template should do it.

Better SEO
: This will happen in the module [{$hugo-mod-meta}](https://github.com/bowman2001/hugo-mod-meta)

Site-wide search
: Javascript library without dependencies called in a modal window --- [this module][search] looks promising.

Social Icons
: Simple icons are looking like the obvious choice.

## Nice to have

### Colors

- An easy way to change the four basic colors and their derivatives in the theme --- will require the additional installation of PostCss.

- Dark Mode

### Icons

- SVG Icons (at the moment the web font set of Google Material Icons is available)

- A choice to use other icon sets than Material Icons

Suggestions are also welcome as new issues in the [repo](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex). Please check out the existing ones.
