A site layout based on classic typographical principles and techniques — without the usual compromises.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

Layout
: Advanced user-friendly design to publish technical Markdown content. All different kinds of pages reside on the same layout grid: 

  - large documentation
  
  - news stream
  
  - blog postings

  - author pages
  
  - in-depth articles (coming)
  {.col2}

Enhanced styling
: Many Markdown attributes and a few custom shortcodes to improve and variate the styling and the layout.
: Light and dark modes follow your OS settings.

Navigation
: All elements needed to sift through the content are generated from data in the frontmatter:
  
  - Site navigation
  
  - Page-to-page
  
  - Breadcrumbs
  
  - Taxonomies
  {.col2}

Full-text search
: The theme is ready for [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app), a very fast and bandwidth-efficient search library for self-hosting.

Icons
: Google’s [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) and [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) for brands can be included by their identifiers. Material Symbols show automatically in all navigational elements of the documentation. All icon sets can also be used as Markdown content (using shortcodes).

Images
: Users need to provide only one large original image, the theme handles the generation of all the needed sizes.

Efficiency
: Sites built with this theme are very fast. Image sets are optimized to minimize the needed bandwidth and loaded lazily, fonts are split into small packages, and icons are embedded inline.
: The build process is also fast, cost-effective, and energy-efficient --- thanks to Hugo.
