Every author listed in the front-matter field `authors` gets a personal page that lists her or his latest contributions.

The author pages are initially auto-generated by Hugo and contain a stub for personal information. To add personal Markdown content and images we need to create an explicit author page with a command in the project root like:

```sh {.left}
hugo new authors/my-name
```

This creates a new Markdown list page with a set of useful front-matter parameters in {$content/authors/my-name/_index.md}:

```yaml
