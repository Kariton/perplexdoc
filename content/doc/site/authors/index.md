Every author or editor listed in the frontmatter field `authors` gets a personal page.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

Every author page is initially auto-generated by Hugo and contains a list of the latest contributions at the bottom. To add personal content and images we need to create an explicit author page with a command in the project root like:

```sh {.left-in}
hugo new authors/your-name
```

This creates a new Markdown file with special frontmatter parameters in {$content/authors/your-name/_index.md}:

```yaml {.left-in}

You add your name as the `title` and a short description of your role or profession to the parameter `description`.

The author page needs two images:
A quadratic `portrait` or avatar with a side length of at least {${{< width/column 1 >}}}. This image appears in all your postings and cards referencing them.
A `featured` image as usual.

You have the option to add links to other sites or services which are symbolized by icons. The section `follow_icons` is meant for social networks with the option to follow your postings. The section `contact_icons` is meant for services that allow to reach you directly.

Every list entry starts with a dash and expects three parameters:

`name`
: The name of the service.

`icon`
: The name for an icon of the open-source project [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org). You can find and pick every available icon on their page.

  The icons are open-source but you have to consider possible legal restrictions of their use from the corporations or organizations they represent!
  {.box-danger}

`url`
: The link to the service.
