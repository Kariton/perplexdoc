Every author listed in the frontmatter field `authors` gets a personal page.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

Every author page is initially auto-generated by Hugo and contains a list of the latest contributions at the bottom. To add personal Markdown content and images we need to create an explicit author page with a command in the project root like:

```sh {.left-in}
hugo new authors/your-name
```

This creates a new Markdown page with special frontmatter parameters in {$content/authors/your-name/_index.md}:

```yaml {.left-in}

You add your name as the `title` and a short description of your role or profession to the parameter `description`.

The author page needs two images: 
A quadratic `portrait` or avatar with a side length of at least {${{< width/column 1 >}}}. This image appears in all your postings and cards referencing them.
A `featured` image as usual.
