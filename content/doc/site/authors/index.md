Every author listed in the front-matter field `authors` gets a personal page that lists her or his latest contributions.

Every author page is initially auto-generated by Hugo. To add personal Markdown content and images we need to create an explicit author page with a command in the project root like:

```sh {.left}
hugo new authors/your-name
```

This creates a new Markdown page with a set of front-matter parameters in {$content/authors/my-name/_index.md}:

```yaml {.left}

You can add your name as the `title` and a short description of your profession to the parameter `description`.

The author page needs a portrait of you as a quadratic image file for the source named `portrait`. This image is also used on all your pages and cards referencing them. It should have a side length of at least {${{< width/column 2 >}}}.

You can add a bigger image to your author page as the featured image.
