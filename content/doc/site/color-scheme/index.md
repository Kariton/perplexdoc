The theme includes a WCAG-compliant color scheme that switches between a **light** and a **dark** mode when the OS environment does.

## Four base colors

The color scheme design is based on four colors with a specific purpose:

Red
: to emphasize a current or intended navigational state.

Blue
: to emphasize internal links.

Green
: to emphasize external links.

Yellow
: to highlight local navigational elements.
{.dl-loose}

The specific color variations of these base colors follow the Hugo logo. The color scheme provides many color variations to structure the content and the navigation.

## WCAG compliance

The minimal contrast ratios between foreground and background colors follow the recommendations of the **W**eb **C**ontent **A**ccessibility **G**uidelines. They are an international standard of the **W**orld **W**ide **W**eb **C**onsortium (W3C).

## Custom color scheme

The file {$assets/css/color-default.css} in the theme folder holds the default color scheme. In case you would like to use another color scheme you can create the file {$assets/css/color.css} in your **project root**. Then, the theme will include this file instead of the default in the main stylesheet. This file needs to define all color variables and you may want to start with a copy of the default.

Creating a WCAG-compliant color scheme for this theme is non-trivial. There is no easy way to calculate all the correct shades of the four base colors automatically â€“ as far as I know. To achieve sufficient contrast ratios for all combinations manual adjustments are necessary because the luminosity is a function of the color.

## Code highlighting

The color variables for highlighting code blocks with Chroma follow the light and dark theme from GitHub which are (mostly) WCAG compliant.
