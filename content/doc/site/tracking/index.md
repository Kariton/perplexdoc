Perplex offers configuration parameters to easily include scripts for a tracking service. Currently **Fathom** and **Google** Analytics (GA4) are directly supported.

Website creators like to get an impression of their audience and want to know how much attention their pages get. And when they start some kind of campaign, they usually want to measure its success.

## Google Analytics 4

Google offers its own widely used [analytics service](https://analytics.google.com). It’s free of charge for many of its extensive functions.

When you place your **Google Measurement ID** in the [main configuration file][gparam] like `googleAnalytics: G-MEASUREMENT_ID` the internal template provided by Hugo gets included into the `<head>` of all your pages.

There is some concern about Google collecting data from website visitors via its analytics software. And that’s why many sites are obligated to inform their visitors about this service and to ask them for an explicit permission to use it.

## Fathom Analytics

Fathom is a smaller company offering its popular privacy-focused service [Fathom Analytics][fathomref]\*. Because they don’t collect any personal data, we don’t need to inform our visitors about this service.

Fathom doesn’t offer as many tools and information as Google. But if you don’t need all this anyway, you will probably like their clear and simple backend. The most important advantage of the service --- at least for me: We can use tracking without an annoying initial banner on our site!

This advantage comes at a (reasonable) price. Fathom doesn’t use the data from your website for anything else than their aggregated analytical information and wants to be paid after a short tryout period.

When you have a fathom id for your site, place it like `fathomSiteID: ABCDEFG` in the [parameter section][fid] of your configuration. And when you are using their _custom domain_ you also need to provide the full link like `fathomCustomDomain: https://custom.yourdomain.com` also in [this section][fcustom].
