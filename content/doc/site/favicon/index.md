Browsers show the **favorite icon** in the tab, the address bar and before bookmarks. It may also be used as an application icon when the website implements the necessary functionality.

![Favorite icon of this site](favicon) The favorite icon is needed in many sizes and --- until recently --- in different image formats. There are still many web services, which create a lot of variants from a single raster image. Fortunately, most browsers now support resizable vectorized icons in the SVG format. We can get away with two files: The SVG and a PNG fallback.

The [real favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) for example generates these icon sets from raster and vector image files for free. This theme is expecting the two files {$favicon.svg} and {$favicon.png} in the folder {$assets/icon}. That should be it.

To use a bunch of raster versions, you need to create the template file {$layouts/partials/head/favicon.html} in your project root. It will override the template from the theme, and you can place the HTML referencing your icon images in the traditional way there. The icon folder needs to be placed in the {$static} directory. It gets copied by Hugo directly to the root of the published folder structure and referencing files there is straightforward.
