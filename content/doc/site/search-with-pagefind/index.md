[Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) is a static search library that scales for large sites and requires no additional hosting. The search indices for self-hosting are generated directly from the HTML content.

The library is available as a node package (install with `npm i pagefind`). We run the indexer every time after Hugo has generated our current site in the project root with `npx pagefind --source "public"`. This call generates the indices and adds a {$_pagefind} directory to our site in the {$public} folder. This folder contains the indices, the Javascript API, and the user interface.

The theme template in the folder {$layouts/search} calls this user interface.
