Taxonomies allow to create site-wide arbitrary groups of content.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

Categories
: form a general classification of the contents. They aim to be mutually exclusive to separate the contents into distinguishable parts &Rightarrow; every page should get only one category. These category groups should be of a similar size. In practice these goals are often not so easy to reach.

Tags
: are labels describing one aspect or property of the content &Rightarrow; every page may have a few tags. As the content grows we should check for tags which contain only one page. This often happens in the beginning but is a good reason to remove tags in the long run.

Series:
: are names for pages that belong directly together â€“ consecutive postings about the same topic for example.
