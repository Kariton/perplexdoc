Replacement codes help to avoid raw HTML in Markdown. Single curly braces and special ASCII characters let Hugo inject tags into the already rendered HTML with regular expressions.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

The codes look like `{*text}`, where `*` is a placeholder for one or more ASCII characters. The superscript tag `<sup>` for example is marked by `^` and fits the following regular expression:

```go-html-template
replaceRE `\{\^([^}]*)\}` "<sup>$1</sup>"
```

All replacements are chained together into one Hugo partial, which processes every piece of rendered content in the templates (mostly `.Content`). These replacements are published separately as a tiny [Hugo module][module].
