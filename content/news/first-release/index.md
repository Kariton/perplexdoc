A new fluid-responsive theme for Hugo is available for test runs.

The release is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta.1) and also included in the repo of [the documentation](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplexdoc).

This [documentation](/doc) is also a demonstration and a test for the theme.

Before the announcement in the Hugo forum, the overview in the documentation for seasoned Hugo users will be ready:

- The usual [one-page Markdown demonstration](/doc/overview/markdown)

- A few remarks about the concept and the goals of this theme.  

- Current and planned features.

The next beta release will include author pages. Iâ€™m planning to implement them as taxonomy pages.
