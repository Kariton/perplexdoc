The theme includes a dark mode now. The theme colors change when the operating system setting does.

The dark mode includes a dark page background and light text colors as usual. It also reduces the overall brightness of the text and images.

Unfortunately, it’s not so easy to change the colors of Hugo’s chroma highlighter. I left the code highlighting untouched for now.
