The theme includes a dark mode now. It follows the dark/light mode setting of the operating system.

The dark mode includes a dark page background and light text colors as usual. It also reduces the overall brightness of text and images.

Unfortunately, it’s not easy to change the colors of Hugo’s chroma highlighter. I left the code highlighting untouched for now.
