We can include a custom color scheme instead of the default one.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

The color scheme for this theme is based on the four base colors red, blue, green, and yellow and every custom scheme should follow this concept, because of their [specific roles](/doc/site/color-scheme).

Creating a WCAG-compliant color scheme for this theme with sufficient contrast ratios like the default scheme requires some effort.
