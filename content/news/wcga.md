The contrast values of the theme are WCGA-compliant in both color modes, light & dark.

There are many tools to evaluate the color contrast of websites, the **W**eb **A**ccessiblity **I**nitiative (WAI) offers a very popular one: [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/). I’m using this tool myself to check for violations of the recommended contrast ratios.

At the moment, the website interface doesn’t load the CSS file and can’t check this site. In case you want to use it, you need to install one of their [browser extensions](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/).
