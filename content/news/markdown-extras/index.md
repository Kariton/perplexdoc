Since version {$0.126.0} Hugo offers to render additional inline markup for super- and subscripts, insertions, and marked content.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

When we like to write 1^st^, H~2~O, ==marked==, or ++inserted content++ we can achieve this with extended Goldmark markup:

```md
1^st^, H~2~O, ==marked==, or ++inserted content++
```

The necessary configuration options for these new markup extensions are described in the [Hugo documentation][doc] and can be enabled separately.

The extensions are part of [Hugo's goldmark extensions][extensions]. Thanks a lot for their implementation suggestions, the integration, and the code improvements to BEP and Joe Mooring.
