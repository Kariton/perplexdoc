**Perplex** is a documentation theme for **Hugo**, the fastest site generator in the world. It produces a typographic layout, which adapts responsively to nearly all screen sizes. It’s designed for optimal legibility down to a view-port of 360 Pixels width.

_Perplex_ has been build on the basis of the **IBM Plex** font family and is best suited for technical content with mixed sections of text and code. The layout is vertically aligned to a **baseline grid** to introduce a comfortable rhythm. Horizontally it’s divided into evenly spaced columns — their number depends on the screen width. On larger screens the **responsive design** is combined with **view-port sized typography**—a.k.a. _fluid typography_—to deliver a coherent layout. The CSS stylesheet is working on recent browsers used by around 95\% of the users in the world.

The content for pages is most suitable delivered by **Markdown** files in a directory tree, which corresponds to the intended website structure. The meta-data for navigational elements, images and other resources needs to be provided in a data markup language: **YAML**, **TOML** or **JSON**. Global data is contained in the project configuration, page specific data in the front-matter section at the beginning of the **Markdown** content files.
