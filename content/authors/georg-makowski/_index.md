I’m engaged in web publishing. My focus lies on a clear and consistent layout structure and optimal legibility on modern screen sizes. I’m specialized in fluid-responsive design because it can integrate many achievements of classic typographic page design into modern websites with several responsive layout variants. A baseline grid for example can bear fruit when we can rely on our layout proportions between at least two breakpoints of our responsive design.

**C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets
: are my main field of expertise. Style sheets are a collection of mechanisms to add fonts and styling to a web document. They’re not a programming language and every rigorous system reducing their complexity for the sake of technical maintainability tends to diminish their capabilities.

    I don’t follow a strict methodology on my projects and combine particular achievements of {=SMACSS} and {=BEM}. Similarly, I use {=SASS} and {=PostCSS} to optimize the style sheet generation.

Markdown
: is a successful heuristic markup system to structure simple text files. Because it’s derived from intuitive markup habits in early text forums and emails it's sometimes overly simplistic or inconsistent. I’m an expert in straitening out its shortcomings and enriching the resulting HTML with attributes or --- if necessary --- with Hugo’s shortcodes.

Hugo
: I’ve been using this engine since version {$0.18} to build fast and reliable static websites and dove deeper into the JAMstack since version {$0.86} when Markdown attributes became available to provide additional styling options for authors. I became an experienced Go-HTML-template programmer since then.

Javascript
: I know my way around vanilla Javascript, Typescript, and Node and like to enhance sites with dynamic capabilities when the result justifies loading additional libraries on demand.

I’m also a writer and speaker (in German) with a focus on the epistemology of the natural sciences, and a lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences{/}in Frankfurt.
