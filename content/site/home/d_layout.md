Realize the possibilities of this layout. Let your content flow onto a baseline grid in evenly spaced columns.

Screens with a view-port width &ge; {$592px} present text and code with an optimized line-length.  

Move and resize figures, images and code boxes with [Markdown attributes]({{< relref "attribute">}}).
